Based on the discussion in

  <20091015165228.GO10505@spearce.org> (patch),
  <20091015173902.GA22262@sigill.intra.peff.net> (agreement)

  Message-ID: <20091015165228.GO10505@spearce.org>

  I weakend the sections on cookies:

  + Authentication
  + --------------

  + Servers SHOULD NOT require HTTP cookies for the purposes of
  + authentication or access control.

  and that's all we say on the matter.  I took out the Servers MUST
  NOT line under session state.
