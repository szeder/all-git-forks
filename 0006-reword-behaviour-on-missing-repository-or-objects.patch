  My original text got taken a bit out of context here.  I guess MUST
  was too strong of a word.  I more ment something like:

    If there is no repository at $GIT_URL, the server MUST NOT respond
    with '200 OK' and a valid info/refs response.  A server SHOULD
    respond with '404 Not Found', '410 Gone', or any other suitable
    HTTP status code which does not imply the resource exists as
    requested.

In addition, address behaviour on missing objects, as suggested by
Junio. His text (see quote in above excerpt) was not used, in favour of
a more general treatment (locations matching $GIT_URL, not just
objects).
