  It's worth making clear here that $GIT_URL will be the path to the repository,
  rather than necessarily just the host upon which the server sits. Perhaps
  including an example, like http://example:8080/repos/example.git
  would make it clearer that there can be a path (and so leading to
  a request like http://example:8080/repos/example.git/info/refs?service=...

  It's also worth clarifying, therefore, that multiple repositories can be served
  by the same process (as with the git server today) by using different path(s).
  And for those that are interested in submodules, it's worth confirming that
  http://example/repos/master.git/child.git/info/refs?service= will ensure
  that the repository is the 'child' git rather than anything else.

The submodule example (/master.git/child.git) seems potentially
confusing - it suggests a setup where the server has a route to a git
repo (child.git) with a parent path containing another git repo
(master.git). It is excluded lest we be seen as encouraging such
mind-boggling setups.
