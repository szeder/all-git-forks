Subject: [PATCH 10/15] also mention missing objects

addressed.

Based on:

  Message-ID: <7vskdss3ei.fsf@alter.siamese.dyndns.org>

  We may also want to add

      If there is no object at $GIT_URL/some/path, the server MUST respond
      with the '404 Not Found' HTTP status code.

  to help dumb clients.
