/*
 * File write-locks as used by Git.
 *
 * When a file at $FILENAME needs to be written, it is done as
 * follows:
 *
 * 1. Obtain a lock on the file by creating a lockfile at path
 *    $FILENAME.lock.  The file is opened for read/write using O_CREAT
 *    and O_EXCL mode to ensure that it doesn't already exist.  Such a
 *    lock file is respected by writers *but not by readers*.
 *
 *    Usually, if $FILENAME is a symlink, then it is resolved, and the
 *    file ultimately pointed to is the one that is locked and later
 *    replaced.  However, if LOCK_NODEREF is used, then $FILENAME
 *    itself is locked and later replaced, even if it is a symlink.
 *
 * 2. Write the new file contents to the lockfile.
 *
 * 3. Move the lockfile to its final destination using rename(2).
 *
 * Instead of (3), the change can be rolled back by deleting lockfile.
 *
 * This module keeps track of all locked files in lock_file_list.
 * When the first file is locked, it registers an atexit(3) handler
 * and a signal handler; when the program exits, the handler rolls
 * back any files that have been locked but were never committed or
 * rolled back.
 *
 * Because the signal handler can be called at any time, a lock_file
 * object must always be in a well-defined state.  The possible states
 * are as follows:
 *
 * - Uninitialized.  In this state the object's on_list field must be
 *   zero but the rest of its contents need not be initialized.  As
 *   soon as the object is used in any way, it is irrevocably
 *   registered in the lock_file_list, and on_list is set.
 *
 * - Locked, lockfile open (after hold_lock_file_for_update() or
 *   hold_lock_file_for_append()).  In this state:
 *   - the lockfile exists
 *   - active is set
 *   - filename holds the filename of the lockfile
 *   - fd holds a file descriptor open for writing to the lockfile
 *   - owner holds the PID of the process that locked the file
 *
 * - Locked, lockfile closed (after close_lock_file() or an
 *   unsuccessful commit_lock_file()).  Same as the previous state,
 *   except that the lockfile is closed and fd is -1.
 *
 * - Unlocked (after commit_lock_file(), rollback_lock_file(), or a
 *   failed attempt to lock).  In this state, filename[0] == '\0' and
 *   fd is -1.  The object is left registered in the lock_file_list,
 *   and on_list is set.
 * - Unlocked (after rollback_lock_file(), a successful
 *   commit_lock_file(), or a failed attempt to lock).  In this state:
 *   - active is unset
 *   - filename[0] == '\0' (usually, though there are transitory states
 *     in which this condition doesn't hold)
 *   - fd is -1
 *   - the object is left registered in the lock_file_list, and
 *     on_list is set.
 *
 * See Documentation/api-lockfile.txt for more information.
