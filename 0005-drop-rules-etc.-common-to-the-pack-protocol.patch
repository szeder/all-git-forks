Subject: [PATCH 05/14] drop rules, etc. common to the pack protocol
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Use obj-id in lieu of id (defined as 40*HEX).

Use zero-id in lieu of 40*"0".

Use refname in lieu of name (not defined).

Drop section on capabilities, since they are already available in
protocol-capabilities.txt.

  Isn't this "MUST be" wrong?

  It is not an advice to the implementors, but the protocol specification
  itself defines what the flush packet means.  IOW, "The author of this
  specification, Shawn, MUST treat a flush packet as a message break or
  terminator in the payload, when designing this protocol."

Capabilities and 'command' ABNF rules under git-upload-pack were
dropped by Nguyễn:

-pkt-line Format
----------------
-
-Much (but not all) of the payload is described around pkt-lines.
-
-A pkt-line is a variable length binary string.  The first four bytes
-of the line indicates the total length of the line, in hexadecimal.
-The total length includes the 4 bytes used to denote the length.
-A line SHOULD BE terminated by an LF, which if present MUST be
-included in the total length.
-
-A pkt-line MAY contain binary data, so implementors MUST ensure all
-pkt-line parsing/formatting routines are 8-bit clean.  The maximum
-length of a pkt-line's data is 65532 bytes (65536 - 4).
-
-Examples (as C-style strings):
-
-  pkt-line          actual value

-  "0006a\n"         "a\n"

-  "000bfoobar\n"    "foobar\n"
-  "0004"            ""

-A pkt-line with a length of 0 ("0000") is a special case and MUST
