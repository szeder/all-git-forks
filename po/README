Core GIT Translations
=====================

This directory holds the translations for the core of Git. This
document describes how to add to and maintain these translations.


Generating a .pot file
----------------------

The po/git.pot file contains a message catalog extracted from Git's
sources. You need to generate it to add new translations with
msginit(1), or update existing ones with msgmerge(1).

Since the file can be automatically generated it's not checked into
git.git. To generate it do, at the top-level:

    make pot


Initializing a .po file
-----------------------

To add a new translation first generate git.pot (see above) and then
in the po/ directory do:

    msginit --locale=XX

Where XX is your locale, e.g. "is", "de" or "pt_BR".

Then edit the automatically generated copyright info in your new XX.po
to be correct, e.g. for Icelandic:
    
    @@ -1,6 +1,6 @@
    -# Icelandic translations for PACKAGE package.
    -# Copyright (C) 2010 THE PACKAGE'S COPYRIGHT HOLDER
    -# This file is distributed under the same license as the PACKAGE package.
    +# Icelandic translations for Git.
    +# Copyright (C) 2010 Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason <avarab@gmail.com>
    +# This file is distributed under the same license as the Git package.
     # Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason <avarab@gmail.com>, 2010.

And change references to PACKAGE VERSION in the PO Header Entry to
just "Git":

    perl -pi -e 's/(?<="Project-Id-Version: )PACKAGE VERSION/Git/' XX.po


Updating a .po file
-------------------

If there's an existing *.po file for your language but you need to
update the translation you first need to generate git.pot (see above)
and then in the po/ directory do:

    msgmerge --add-location --backup=off -U XX.po git.pot

Where XX.po is the file you want to update.
