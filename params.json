  "body": "Git - fast, scalable, distributed revision control system\r\n=========================================================\r\n\r\nGit is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an\r\nunusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations\r\nand full access to internals.\r\n\r\nGit is an Open Source project covered by the GNU General Public\r\nLicense version 2 (some parts of it are under different licenses,\r\ncompatible with the GPLv2). It was originally written by Linus\r\nTorvalds with help of a group of hackers around the net.\r\n\r\nPlease read the file [INSTALL][] for installation instructions.\r\n\r\nMany Git online resources are accessible from http://git-scm.com/\r\nincluding full documentation and Git related tools.\r\n\r\nSee [Documentation/gittutorial.txt][] to get started, then see\r\n[Documentation/giteveryday.txt][] for a useful minimum set of commands, and\r\nDocumentation/git-*commandname*.txt for documentation of each command.\r\nIf git has been correctly installed, then the tutorial can also be\r\nread with \"man gittutorial\" or \"git help tutorial\", and the\r\ndocumentation of each command with \"man git-*commandname*\" or \"git help\r\n*commandname*\".\r\n\r\nCVS users may also want to read [Documentation/gitcvs-migration.txt][]\r\n(\"man gitcvs-migration\" or \"git help cvs-migration\" if git is\r\ninstalled).\r\n\r\nThe user discussion and development of Git take place on the Git\r\nmailing list -- everyone is welcome to post bug reports, feature\r\nrequests, comments and patches to git@vger.kernel.org (read\r\n[Documentation/SubmittingPatches][] for instructions on patch submission).\r\nTo subscribe to the list, send an email with just \"subscribe git\" in\r\nthe body to majordomo@vger.kernel.org. The mailing list archives are\r\navailable at http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/,\r\nhttp://marc.info/?l=git and other archival sites.\r\n\r\nThe maintainer frequently sends the \"What's cooking\" reports that\r\nlist the current status of various development topics to the mailing\r\nlist.  The discussion following them give a good reference for\r\nproject status, development direction and remaining tasks.\r\n\r\nThe name \"git\" was given by Linus Torvalds when he wrote the very\r\nfirst version. He described the tool as \"the stupid content tracker\"\r\nand the name as (depending on your mood):\r\n\r\n - random three-letter combination that is pronounceable, and not\r\n   actually used by any common UNIX command.  The fact that it is a\r\n   mispronunciation of \"get\" may or may not be relevant.\r\n - stupid. contemptible and despicable. simple. Take your pick from the\r\n   dictionary of slang.\r\n - \"global information tracker\": you're in a good mood, and it actually\r\n   works for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room.\r\n - \"goddamn idiotic truckload of sh*t\": when it breaks\r\n\r\n[INSTALL]: INSTALL\r\n[Documentation/gittutorial.txt]: Documentation/gittutorial.txt\r\n[Documentation/giteveryday.txt]: Documentation/giteveryday.txt\r\n[Documentation/gitcvs-migration.txt]: Documentation/gitcvs-migration.txt\r\n[Documentation/SubmittingPatches]: Documentation/SubmittingPatches\r\n",
