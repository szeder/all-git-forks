-Capability include-tag
-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-
-When packing an object that an annotated tag points at, include the
-tag object too.  Clients can request this if they want to fetch
-tags, but don't know which tags they will need until after they
-receive the branch data.  By enabling include-tag an extra call
-to upload-pack can be avoided.

-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-
-When packing a deltified object the base is not included if the base
-is reachable from an object listed in the COMMON set by the client.
-This reduces the bandwidth required to transfer, but it does slightly
