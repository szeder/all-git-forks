PURPOSE
To allow the specification of "rename hints", which conceptually have the form:
<this file> <is/is-not related to> <this file>

GOALS
 - allow automatic "aggressive" search for history when using "blame".
 - prevent search when using "blame" from entering files which are /not/
   related.
 - prevent --stat from showing unrelated-but-similar-looking files as
   related.

IMPLEMENTATION
 - info/rename-hints
 - git notes? (attach hints to specific commit?)
 - allow blobs to be specified
 - allow tree+blob to be specified (blob within tree not related to, etc)
 - allow commit+blob to be specified
