  This is a bit confusing.

  If you as a server administrator want to disable the smart upload-pack for
  one repository (but not for other repositories), you would not be able to
  force smart clients to fall back to the dumb protocol by giving "403" for
  that repository.

  Maybe in 2 years somebody smarter than us will have invented a more
  efficient git-upload-pack-2 service, which is the only fetch protocol his
  server supports other than dumb.  If your v1 smart client asks for the
  original git-upload-pack service and gets a "403", you won't be able to
  fall back to "dumb".

  The solution for such cases likely is to pretend as if you are a dumb
  server for the smart request.  That unfortunately means that the first
  sentence is misleading, and the second sentence is also an inappropriate
  advice.

 Smart Server Response
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
-Smart servers MUST respond with the smart server reply format.
-
 If the server does not recognize the requested service name, or the
 requested service name has been disabled by the server administrator,
 the server MUST respond with the '403 Forbidden' HTTP status code.
 
+Otherwise, smart servers MUST respond with the smart server reply
+format for the requested service name.
+
 Cache-Control headers SHOULD be used to disable caching of the
 returned entity.
