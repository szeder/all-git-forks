git-var(1)
==========

NAME
----
git-var - Show a git logical variable


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git var' ( -l | <variable>... )

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Prints one or more git logical variables, separated by newlines.

Note that some variables may contain newlines themselves (e.g.,
`GIT_EDITOR`), and it is therefore possible to receive ambiguous output
when requesting multiple variables. This can be mitigated by putting any
such variables at the end of the list.

OPTIONS
-------
-l::
	Cause the logical variables to be listed. In addition, all the
	variables of the git configuration file .git/config are listed
	as well. (However, the configuration variables listing functionality
	is deprecated in favor of `git config -l`.)

EXAMPLE
--------
	$ git var GIT_AUTHOR_IDENT
	Eric W. Biederman <ebiederm@lnxi.com> 1121223278 -0600


VARIABLES
----------
GIT_AUTHOR_IDENT::
    The author of a piece of code.

GIT_AUTHOR_EXPLICIT::
    Outputs "1" if the author identity was provided explicitly by the
    user (in the config or environment), or "0" if it was determined
    implicitly from the system.

GIT_COMMITTER_IDENT::
    The person who put a piece of code into git.

GIT_COMMITTER_EXPLICIT::
    Like GIT_AUTHOR_EXPLICIT, but for the committer ident.

GIT_EDITOR::
    Text editor for use by git commands.  The value is meant to be
    interpreted by the shell when it is used.  Examples: `~/bin/vi`,
    `$SOME_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE`, `"C:\Program Files\Vim\gvim.exe"
    --nofork`.  The order of preference is the `$GIT_EDITOR`
    environment variable, then `core.editor` configuration, then
    `$VISUAL`, then `$EDITOR`, and then the default chosen at compile
    time, which is usually 'vi'.
ifdef::git-default-editor[]
    The build you are using chose '{git-default-editor}' as the default.
endif::git-default-editor[]

GIT_PAGER::
    Text viewer for use by git commands (e.g., 'less').  The value
    is meant to be interpreted by the shell.  The order of preference
    is the `$GIT_PAGER` environment variable, then `core.pager`
    configuration, then `$PAGER`, and then the default chosen at
    compile time (usually 'less').
ifdef::git-default-pager[]
    The build you are using chose '{git-default-pager}' as the default.
endif::git-default-pager[]
