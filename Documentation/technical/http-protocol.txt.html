		<h1>HTTP transfer protocols</h1>
		<h1>=======================</h1>

		<div>Git supports two HTTP based transfer protocols. A "dumb"
			protocol which requires only a standard HTTP server on the server end
			of the connection, and a "smart" protocol which requires a Git aware
			CGI (or server module). This document describes both protocols.</div>

		<div>As a design feature smart clients can automatically upgrade
			"dumb" protocol URLs to smart URLs. This permits all users to have
			the same published URL, and the peers automatically select the most
			efficient transport available to them.</div>

		<h3>URL Format</h3>
		<h3>----------</h3>

		<div>URLs for Git repositories accessed by HTTP use the standard
			HTTP URL syntax documented by RFC 1738, so they are of the form:</div>

		<pre>  http://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;path&gt;?&lt;searchpart&gt;
</pre>

		<div>Within this documentation the placeholder `$GIT_URL` will
			stand for the http:// repository URL entered by the end-user.</div>

		<div>Servers SHOULD handle all requests to locations matching
			`$GIT_URL`, as both the "smart" and "dumb" HTTP protocols used by Git
			operate by appending additional path components onto the end of the
			user supplied `$GIT_URL` string.</div>

		<div>An example of a dumb client requesting for a loose object:</div>

		<pre>  $GIT_URL:     http://example.com:8080/git/repo.git
  URL request:  http://example.com:8080/git/repo.git/objects/d0/49f6c27a2244e12041955e262a404c7faba355
</pre>

		<div>An example of a smart request to a catch-all gateway:</div>

		<pre>  $GIT_URL:     http://example.com/daemon.cgi?svc=git&q=
  URL request:  http://example.com/daemon.cgi?svc=git&q=/info/refs&service=git-receive-pack
</pre>

		<div>An example of a request to a submodule:</div>

		<pre>  $GIT_URL:     http://example.com/git/repo.git/path/submodule.git
  URL request:  http://example.com/git/repo.git/path/submodule.git/info/refs
</pre>

		<div>Clients MUST strip a trailing `/`, if present, from the
			user supplied `$GIT_URL` string to prevent empty path tokens (`//`)
			from appearing in any URL sent to a server. Compatible clients MUST
			expand `$GIT_URL/info/refs` as `foo/info/refs` and not
			`foo//info/refs`.</div>

		<h3>Authentication</h3>
		<h3>--------------</h3>

		<div>Standard HTTP authentication is used if authentication is
			required to access a repository, and MAY be configured and enforced
			by the HTTP server software.</div>

		<div>Because Git repositories are accessed by standard path
			components server administrators MAY use directory based permissions
			within their HTTP server to control repository access.</div>

		<div>Clients SHOULD support Basic authentication as described by
			RFC 2617. Servers SHOULD support Basic authentication by relying upon
			the HTTP server placed in front of the Git server software.</div>

		<div>Servers SHOULD NOT require HTTP cookies for the purposes of
			authentication or access control.</div>

		<div>Clients and servers MAY support other common forms of HTTP
			based authentication, such as Digest authentication.</div>

		<h3>SSL</h3>
		<h3>---</h3>

		<div>Clients and servers SHOULD support SSL, particularly to
			protect passwords when relying on Basic HTTP authentication.</div>

		<div>Session State -------------</div>

		<div>The Git over HTTP protocol (much like HTTP itself) is
			stateless from the perspective of the HTTP server side. All state
			MUST be retained and managed by the client process. This permits
			simple round-robin load-balancing on the server side, without needing
			to worry about state management.</div>
		<div>Clients MUST NOT require state management on the server
			side in order to function correctly.</div>
		<div>Servers MUST NOT require HTTP cookies in order to function
			correctly. Clients MAY store and forward HTTP cookies during request
			processing as described by RFC 2616 (HTTP/1.1). Servers SHOULD ignore
			any cookies sent by a client.</div>

		<div>General Request Processing --------------------------</div>
		<div>Except where noted, all standard HTTP behavior SHOULD be
			assumed by both client and server. This includes (but is not
			necessarily limited to):</div>
		<div>If there is no repository at `$GIT_URL`, or the resource
			pointed to by a location matching `$GIT_URL` does not exist, the
			server MUST NOT respond with `200 OK` response. A server SHOULD
			respond with `404 Not Found`, `410 Gone`, or any other suitable HTTP
			status code which does not imply the resource exists as requested.</div>
		<div>If there is a repository at `$GIT_URL`, but access is not
			currently permitted, the server MUST respond with the `403 Forbidden`
			HTTP status code.</div>
		<div>Servers SHOULD support both HTTP 1.0 and HTTP 1.1. Servers
			SHOULD support chunked encoding for both request and response bodies.
		</div>
		<div>Clients SHOULD support both HTTP 1.0 and HTTP 1.1. Clients
			SHOULD support chunked encoding for both request and response bodies.
		</div>
		<div>Servers MAY return ETag and/or Last-Modified headers.</div>
		<div>Clients MAY revalidate cached entities by including
			If-Modified-Since and/or If-None-Match request headers.</div>
		<div>Servers MAY return `304 Not Modified` if the relevant
			headers appear in the request and the entity has not changed. Clients
			MUST treat `304 Not Modified` identical to `200 OK` by reusing the
			cached entity.</div>
		<div>Clients MAY reuse a cached entity without revalidation if
			the Cache-Control and/or Expires header permits caching. Clients and
			servers MUST follow RFC 2616 for cache controls.</div>

		<h3 class='lang-en'>Discovering References</h3>
		<h3 class='lang-zh'>发现引用</h3>

		<h3>Dumb Server Response</h3>
		<h3>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^</h3>

		<div>Dumb servers MUST respond with the dumb server reply
			format.</div>
		<div>See the prior section under dumb clients for a more
			detailed description of the dumb server response.</div>

		<h3>Smart Server Response</h3>
		<h3>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^</h3>

		<div>If the server does not recognize the requested service
			name, or the requested service name has been disabled by the server
			administrator, the server MUST respond with the `403 Forbidden` HTTP
			status code.</div>

		<div>Otherwise, smart servers MUST respond with the smart server
			reply format for the requested service name.</div>

		<div>Cache-Control headers SHOULD be used to disable caching of
			the returned entity.</div>

		<div>The Content-Type MUST be
			`application/x-$servicename-advertisement`. Clients SHOULD fall back
			to the dumb protocol if another content type is returned. When
			falling back to the dumb protocol clients SHOULD NOT make an
			additional request to `$GIT_URL/info/refs`, but instead SHOULD use
			the response already in hand. Clients MUST NOT continue if they do
			not support the dumb protocol.</div>

		<div>Clients MUST validate the status code is either `200 OK` or
			`304 Not Modified`.</div>

		<div>Clients MUST validate the first five bytes of the response
			entity matches the regex `^[0-9a-f]{4}#`. If this test fails, clients
			MUST NOT continue.</div>

		<div>Clients MUST parse the entire response as a sequence of
			pkt-line records.</div>

		<div>Clients MUST verify the first pkt-line is `#
			service=$servicename`. Servers MUST set $servicename to be the
			request parameter value. Servers SHOULD include an LF at the end of
			this line. Clients MUST ignore an LF at the end of the line.</div>

		<div>Servers MUST terminate the response with the magic `0000`
			end pkt-line marker.</div>

		<div>The returned response is a pkt-line stream describing each
			ref and its known value. The stream SHOULD be sorted by name
			according to the C locale ordering. The stream SHOULD include the
			default ref named `HEAD` as the first ref. The stream MUST include
			capability declarations behind a NUL on the first ref.</div>

		<pre>  smart_reply     =  PKT-LINE("# service=$servicename" LF)
		     ref_list
		     "0000"
  ref_list        =  empty_list / non_empty_list

		<h3>The Negotiation Algorithm</h3>
		<h3>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</h3>

		<div>The computation to select the minimal pack proceeds as
			follows (C = client, S = server):</div>
		<div>'init step:'</div>
		<div>C: Use ref discovery to obtain the advertised refs.</div>
		<div>C: Place any object seen into set `advertised`.</div>
		<div>C: Build an empty set, `common`, to hold the objects that
			are later determined to be on both ends.</div>
		<div>C: Build a set, `want`, of the objects from `advertised`
			the client wants to fetch, based on what it saw during ref discovery.</div>
		<div>C: Start a queue, `c_pending`, ordered by commit time
			(popping newest first). Add all client refs. When a commit is popped
			from the queue its parents SHOULD be automatically inserted back.
			Commits MUST only enter the queue once.</div>
		<div>'one compute step:'</div>
		<div>C: Send one `$GIT_URL/git-upload-pack` request:</div>
		<pre>   C: 0032want &lt;want #1&gt;...............................
   C: 0032want &lt;want #2&gt;...............................
   ....

   C: 0032have &lt;have #2&gt;...............................
   ....
   C: 0000
</pre>
		<div>The stream is organized into "commands", with each command
			appearing by itself in a pkt-line. Within a command line, the text
			leading up to the first space is the command name, and the remainder
			of the line to the first LF is the value. Command lines are
			terminated with an LF as the last byte of the pkt-line value.</div>
		<div>Commands MUST appear in the following order, if they appear
			at all in the request stream:</div>
		<div>* "want" * "have"</div>
		<div>The stream is terminated by a pkt-line flush (`0000`).</div>
		<div>A single "want" or "have" command MUST have one hex
			formatted SHA-1 as its value. Multiple SHA-1s MUST be sent by sending
			multiple commands.</div>
		<div>The `have` list is created by popping the first 32 commits
			from `c_pending`. Less can be supplied if `c_pending` empties.</div>
		<div>If the client has sent 256 "have" commits and has not yet
			received one of those back from `s_common`, or the client has emptied
			`c_pending` it SHOULD include a "done" command to let the server know
			it won't proceed:</div>
		<pre>   C: 0009done
</pre>
		<div>S: Parse the git-upload-pack request:</div>
		<div>Verify all objects in `want` are directly reachable from
			refs.</div>
		<div>The server MAY walk backwards through history or through
			the reflog to permit slightly stale requests.</div>
		<div>If no "want" objects are received, send an error: TODO:
			Define error if no "want" lines are requested.</div>
		<div>If any "want" object is not reachable, send an error: TODO:
			Define error if an invalid "want" is requested.</div>
		<div>Create an empty list, `s_common`.</div>
		<div>If "have" was sent:</div>
		<div>Loop through the objects in the order supplied by the
			client.</div>
		<div>For each object, if the server has the object reachable
			from a ref, add it to `s_common`. If a commit is added to `s_common`,
			do not add any ancestors, even if they also appear in `have`.</div>
		<div>S: Send the git-upload-pack response:</div>
		<div>If the server has found a closed set of objects to pack or
			the request ends with "done", it replies with the pack. TODO:
			Document the pack based response</div>
		<pre>   S: PACK...
</pre>
		<div>The returned stream is the side-band-64k protocol supported
			by the git-upload-pack service, and the pack is embedded into stream
			1. Progress messages from the server side MAY appear in stream 2.</div>
		<div>Here a "closed set of objects" is defined to have at least
			one path from every "want" to at least one "common" object.</div>
