NAME
----
git-list-files - List files

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git list-files [options] [<pathspec>...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
List files (by default in current working directory) that are in the
index. Depending on the chosen options, maybe only modified files in
working tree are shown, or untracked files... The builtin alias "ls"
is set to "list-files".

OPTIONS
-------
-c::
--cached::
	Show cached files (default)

-d::
--deleted::
	Show deleted files in index, compared to HEAD

-a::
--added::
	Show added files in index, compared to HEAD

-m::
--modified::
	Show modified files in index, compared to HEAD. This implies
	--deleted and --added

-D::
--wt-deleted::
	Show deleted files in working directory

-A::
--wt-added::
	Show added files in working directory

-M::
--wt-modified::
	Show modified files in working directory. This implies
	--wt-deleted and --wt-added

-o::
--others::
	Show untracked files (and only unignored ones unless -i is
	specified)

-i::
--ignored::
	Show only ignored files. When showing files in the index,
	print only those matched by an exclude pattern. When showing
	"other" files, show only those matched by an exclude pattern.

-u::
--unmerged::
	Show unmerged files

-F::
--classify::
	Append indicator (one of `*/=>@|&`, which is executable,
	directory, socket, Solaris door, symlink, fifo, or submodule
	respectively) to entries.

--color[=<when>]::
--no-color::
	Color file names. The value must be `always`, `never`, or
	`auto`. `--no-color` is equivalent to
	`--color=never`. `--color` is equivalent to
	`--color=auto`. See configuration variable `color.list-files`
	for the default settings.

--column[=<options>]::
--no-column::
-1::
	Display files in columns. See configuration variable column.ui
	for option syntax. `--column` and `--no-column` without options
	are equivalent to 'always' and 'never' respectively.
	`-1` is a shortcut for --no-column.

--max-depth=<depth>::
--recursive::
-R::
	For each <pathspec> given on command line, descend at most <depth>
	levels of directories. A negative value means no limit.
	This option is ignored if <pathspec> contains active wildcards.
	In other words if "a*" matches a directory named "a*",
	"*" is matched literally so --max-depth is still effective.
	`-R` or `--recursive` is equivalent of `--max-depth=-1`
	(infinite recursion).  The default is `--max-depth=0`.

--tag::
--no-tag::
	Usually when tags are displayed by the left of the file name if
	there are more than one file selection. Use either of these options
	to force always or never display tags.

<pathspec>::
	Files to show. :(glob) magic is enabled by default.
