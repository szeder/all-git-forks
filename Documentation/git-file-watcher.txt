git-file-watcher(1)
===================

NAME
----
git-file-watcher - File update notification daemon

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git file-watcher' [options] <socket directory>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This program watches file changes in a git working directory and let
Git now what files have been changed so that Git does not have to call
lstat(2) to detect that itself. Config key filewatcher.path needs to
be set to `<socket directory>` so Git knows how to contact to the file
watcher.

This program is only supported under Linux with inotify(7) support.

OPTIONS
-------
--detach::
	Run in background.

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
Setting environment variable `GIT_TEST_WATCHED` to a non-zero number
makes Git communicate with the file watcher, but do lstat anyway to
verify that the file watcher results. Setting to 1 prints warning when
file watcher fails to monitor files correctly. Setting to 2 aborts Git
when it happens.

BUGS
----
On Linux, file watcher may fail to detect changes if you move the work
tree from outside. For example if you have work tree at
`/tmp/foo/work`, you move `/tmp/foo` to `/tmp/bar`, make some changes
in `/tmp/bar/work` and move `/tmp/bar` back to `/tmp/foo`, changes
won't get noticed. Moving `/tmp/foo/work` to something else is fine.

inotify may not work well with network filesystems and a few special
others. Check inotify documents.
