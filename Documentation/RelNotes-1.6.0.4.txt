GIT v1.6.0.4 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.6.0.3
--------------------

* 'git-add -p' said "No changes" when only binary files were changed.

* git-archive did not work correctly in bare repositories.

* when we refuse to detect renames because there are too many new or
  deleted files, we did not say how many there are.

* 'git-push --mirror' tried and failed to push the stash; there is no
  point in sending it to begin with.

* 'git-send-email' had a small fd leak while scanning directory.

* git-svn used deprecated 'git-foo' form of subcommand invocaition.

* Plugged small memleaks here and there.

* Also contains many documentation updates.
