git-ff-refs(1)
============

NAME
----
git-ff-refs - Fast-forward each local branch to its upstream (if possible)


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git ff-refs' [<options>]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Update local branches to their tracked upstream if and only if the local branch
can be fast-forwarded to the upstream ref.  Local branches which have diverged
from the upstream will not be updated.

Each local branch tracking an upstream will be reported with a status based on
whether or not it it was updated.  The statuses are:

	UP-TO-DATE - The local branch is the same or equal to the upstream
	UPDATED - The branch was fast forwarded
	WOULD-UPDATE - With `--dry-run`, the branch is fast forwardable
	REMOTE-MISSING - The branch is tracking an upstream that is not present
	NON-FAST-FORWARD - The branch has diverged from the upstream
	SKIPPED - With `--skip-worktrees` the branch is fast forwardable but checked
		out in a local worktree
	WOULD-SKIP - With `--skip-worktrees` and `--dry-run`, the branch is fast
		forwardable but checked out in a local worktree
	UNABLE-TO-UPDATE - An error occurred while trying to update the branch

OPTIONS
-------
--dry-run::
	Report the updatable state of each branch without acutally updating anything.
	In a dry run, fast-forwardable branches are marked 'WOULD-UPDATE' instead of
	'UPDATED'.

--skip-worktrees::
	Does not update branches which are checked out in any worktree.  Branches
	which are fast-forwardable that are checked out in any worktree are marked
	'SKIPPED'.  If `--dry-run` is also set, those branches are marked 'WOULD-SKIP'.
