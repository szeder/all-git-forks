NAME
----
git-name-rev - Find symbolic names for given revs


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git name-rev' [--tags] [--refs=<pattern>] [--algorithm=[default|weight]]
	       ( --all | --stdin | <committish>... )

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Finds symbolic names suitable for human digestion for revisions
given in any format parsable by 'git rev-parse'.


OPTIONS
-------

--tags::
	Do not use branch names, but only tags to name the commits

--refs=<pattern>::
	Only use refs whose names match a given shell pattern.

--all::
	List all commits reachable from all refs

--stdin::
	Read from stdin, append "(<rev_name>)" to all sha1's of nameable
	commits, and pass to stdout

--name-only::
	Instead of printing both the SHA-1 and the name, print only
	the name.  If given with --tags the usual tag prefix of
	"tags/" is also omitted from the name, matching the output
	of `git-describe` more closely.

--no-undefined::
	Die with error code != 0 when a reference is undefined,
	instead of printing `undefined`.

--always::
	Show uniquely abbreviated commit object as fallback.

--algorithm=default::
	Name commits based on the ref that is reachable with the
	smallest number of hops.  This is reasonably fast, but can
	give surprisingly irrelevant results when you merged a side
	branch that is based on an ancient codebase and with very
	small number of commits on it.

--algorithm=weight::
	Name commits based on the oldest ref that contains it.  This
	is way more expensive than the default behaviour of the
	command, in which commits are named based on the ref that
	is topologically the closest, but gives more intuitive
	answer to the question: what is the oldest tag that contains
	this commit?


EXAMPLE
-------

Given a commit, find out where it is relative to the local refs. Say somebody
wrote you about that fantastic commit 33db5f4d9027a10e477ccf054b2c1ab94f74c85a.
Of course, you look into the commit, but that only tells you what happened, but
not the context.

Enter 'git name-rev':

------------
% git name-rev 33db5f4d9027a10e477ccf054b2c1ab94f74c85a
33db5f4d9027a10e477ccf054b2c1ab94f74c85a tags/v0.99~940
------------

Now you are wiser, because you know that it happened 940 revisions before v0.99.

Another nice thing you can do is:

------------
% git log | git name-rev --stdin
