git-credential-store(1)
=======================

NAME
----
git-credential-store - helper to store credentials on disk

SYNOPSIS
--------
-------------------
git config credential.helper 'store [options]'
-------------------

DESCRIPTION
-----------

NOTE: Using this helper will store your passwords unencrypted on disk,
protected only by filesystem permissions. If this is not an acceptable
security tradeoff, try linkgit:git-credential-cache[1], or find a helper
that integrates with secure storage provided by your operating system.

This command requests credentials from the user and stores them
indefinitely on disk for use by future git programs.

You probably don't want to invoke this command directly; it is meant to
be used as a credential helper by other parts of git. See
linkgit:gitcredentials[7] or `EXAMPLES` below.

OPTIONS
-------

--store=<path>::

	Use `<path>` to store credentials. The file will have its
	filesystem permissions set to prevent other users on the system
	from reading it, but will not be encrypted or otherwise
	protected.

--chain <helper>::

	Specify an external helper to use for retrieving credentials
	from the user, instead of the default method. The resulting
	credentials are then stored as normal. This option can be
	given multiple times; each chained helper will be tried until
	credentials are received.

Git may provide other options to the program when it is called as a
credential helper; see linkgit:gitcredentials[7].

EXAMPLES
--------

The point of this helper is to reduce the number of times you must type
your username or password. For example:

------------------------------------
$ git config credential.helper store
$ git push http://example.com/repo.git
Username: <type your username>
Password: <type your password>

[several days later]
$ git push http://example.com/repo.git
[your credentials are used automatically]
