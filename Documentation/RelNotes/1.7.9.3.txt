Git v1.7.9.3 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.7.9.2
--------------------

 * "git p4" (in contrib/) submit the changes to a wrong place when the
   "--use-client-spec" option is set.

 * The config.mak.autogen generated by optional autoconf support tried
   to link the binary with -lintl even when libintl.h is missing from
   the system.

 * "git add --refresh <pathspec>" used to warn about unmerged paths
   outside the given pathspec.

Also contains minor fixes and documentation updates.
