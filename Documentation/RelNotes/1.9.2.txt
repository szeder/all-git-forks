Git v1.9.2 Release Notes
========================

Fixes since v1.9.1
------------------

 * "git mv" that moves a submodule forgot to adjust the array that
   uses to keep track of which submodules were to be moved to update
   its configuration.

 * Length limit for the pathname used when removing a path in a deep
   subdirectory has been removed to avoid buffer overflows.

 * The test helper lib-terminal always run an actual test_expect_*
   when included, which screwed up with the use of skil-all that may
   have to be done later.

 * "git index-pack" used a wrong variable to name the keep-file in an
   error message when the file cannot be written or closed.

 * "rebase -i" produced a broken insn sheet when the title of a commit
   happened to contain '\n' (or ended with '\c') due to a careless use
   of 'echo'.

 * There were a few instances of 'git-foo' remaining in the
   documentation that should have been spelled 'git foo'.

 * Serving objects from a shallow repository needs to write a
   new file to hold the temporary shallow boundaries but it was not
   cleaned when we exit due to die() or a signal.

 * When "git stash pop" stops after failing to apply the stash
   (e.g. due to conflicting changes), the stash is not dropped. State
   that explicitly in the output to let the users know.

 * The labels in "git status" output that describe the nature of
   conflicts (e.g. "both deleted") were limited to 20 bytes, which was
   too short for some l10n (e.g. fr).
