Git v2.8.2 Release Notes
========================

Fixes since v2.8.1
------------------

 * The embedded args argv-array in the child process is used to build
   the command line to run pack-objects instead of using a separate
   array of strings.

 * Bunch of tests on "git clone" has been renumbered for better
   organization.

 * The tests that involve running httpd leaked the system-wide
   configuration in /etc/gitconfig to the tested environment.

 * "index-pack --keep=<msg>" was broken since v2.1.0 timeframe.

 * "git config --get-urlmatch", unlike other variants of the "git
   config --get" family, did not signal error with its exit status
   when there was no matching configuration.

 * The "--local-env-vars" and "--resolve-git-dir" options of "git
   rev-parse" failed to work outside a repository when the command's
   option parsing was rewritten in 1.8.5 era.

 * Fetching of history by naming a commit object name directly didn't
   work across remote-curl transport.

 * A small memory leak in an error codepath has been plugged in xdiff
   code.

 * strbuf_getwholeline() did not NUL-terminate the buffer on certain
   corner cases in its error codepath.

 * The startup_info data, which records if we are working inside a
   repository (among other things), are now uniformly available to Git
   subcommand implementations, and Git avoids attempting to touch
   references when we are not in a repository.

 * "git mergetool" did not work well with conflicts that both sides
   deleted.

 * "git send-email" had trouble parsing alias file in mailrc format
   when lines in it had trailing whitespaces on them.

 * When "git merge --squash" stopped due to conflict, the concluding
   "git commit" failed to read in the SQUASH_MSG that shows the log
   messages from all the squashed commits.

 * "git merge FETCH_HEAD" dereferenced NULL pointer when merging
   nothing into an unborn history (which is arguably unusual usage,
   which perhaps was the reason why nobody noticed it).

Also contains minor documentation updates and code clean-ups.
