Git v1.7.9.2 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.7.9.1
--------------------

* The error message emitted when we see an empty loose object was
  not phrased correctly.

* The code to ask for password did not fall back to the terminal
  input when GIT_ASKPASS is set but does not work (e.g. lack of X
  with GUI askpass helper).

* map_user() was not rewriting its output correctly, which resulted
  in the user visible symptom that "git blame -e" sometimes showed
  excess '>' at the end of email addresses.

* "git checkout -b" did not allow switching out of an unborn branch.

* "git commit" refused to create a commit when entries added with
  "add -N" remained in the index, without telling Git what their content
  in the next commit should be. We should have created the commit without
  these paths.

* Search box in "gitweb" did not accept non-ASCII characters correctly.

Also contains minor fixes and documentation updates.
