Git v1.7.10 Release Notes
=========================

Updates since v1.7.9
--------------------

UI, Workflows & Features

 * Improved handling of views, labels and branches in git-p4 (in contrib).

 * "git-p4" (in contrib) suffered from unnecessary merge conflicts when
   p4 expanded the embedded $RCS$-like keywords; it can be now told to
   unexpand them.

 * Some "git-svn" updates.

 * "vcs-svn"/"svn-fe" learned to read dumps with svn-deltas and
   support incremental imports.

 * The configuration mechanism learned an "include" facility; an
   assignment to the include.path pseudo-variable causes the named
   file to be included in-place when Git looks up configuration
   variables.

 * A content filter (clean/smudge) used to be just a way to make the
   recorded contents "more useful", and allowed to fail; a filter can
   new optionally be marked as "required".

 * "git am" learned to pass "-b" option to underlying "git mailinfo", so
   that bracketed string other than "PATCH" at the beginning can be kept.

 * "git clone" learned "--single-branch" option to limit cloning to a
   single branch (surprise!).

 * "git clone" learned to detach the HEAD in the resulting repository
   when the source repository's HEAD does not point to a branch.

 * When showing a patch while ignoring whitespace changes, the context
   lines are taken from the postimage, in order to make it easier to
   view the output.

 * "diff-highlight" filter (in contrib/) was updated to produce more
   aesthetically pleasing output.

 * "git merge" in an interactive session learned to spawn the editor
   by default to let the user edit the auto-generated merge message,
   to encourage people to explain their merges better. Legacy scripts
   can export GIT_MERGE_AUTOEDIT=no to retain the historical behavior.
   Both "git merge" and "git pull" can be given --no-edit from the
   command line to accept the auto-generated merge message.

 * "git push" learned the "--prune" option, similar to "git fetch".

 * "git tag --list" can be given "--points-at <object>" to limit its
   output to those that point at the given object.

 * "gitweb" allows intermediate entries in the directory hierarchy
   that leads to a projects to be clicked, which in turn shows the
   list of projects inside that directory.

 * "gitweb" learned to read various pieces of information for the
   repositories lazily, instead of reading everything that could be
   needed (including the ones that are not necessary for a specific
   task).

Performance

 * During "git upload-pack" in response to "git fetch", unnecessary calls
   to parse_object() have been eliminated, to help performance in
   repositories with excessive number of refs.

Internal Implementation (please report possible regressions)

 * Recursive call chains in "git index-pack" to deal with long delta
   chains have been flattened, to reduce the stack footprint.

 * Use of add_extra_ref() API is now gone, to make it possible to
   cleanly restructure the overall refs API.

 * The command line parser of "git pack-objects" now uses parse-options
   API.

 * The test suite supports the new "test_pause" helper function.

 * Parallel to the test suite, there is a beginning of performance
   benchmarking framework.

 * t/Makefile is adjusted to prevent newer versions of GNU make from
   running tests in seemingly random order.

Also contains minor documentation updates and code clean-ups.


Fixes since v1.7.9
------------------

Unless otherwise noted, all the fixes since v1.7.9 in the maintenance
releases are contained in this release (see release notes to them for
details).

 * The bulk check-in codepath streamed contents that needs
   smudge/clean filters without running them, instead of punting and
   delegating to the codepath to run filters after slurping everything
   to core.
   (merge 4f22b10 jk/maint-avoid-streaming-filtered-contents later to maint).

 * When the filter driver exits before reading the content before the
   main git process writes the contents to be filtered to the pipe to
   it, the latter could be killed with SIGPIPE instead of ignoring
   such an event as an error.
   (merge 6424c2a jb/filter-ignore-sigpipe later to maint).

 * When a remote helper exits before reading the blank line from the
   main git process to signal the end of commands, the latter could be
   killed with SIGPIPE. Instead we should ignore such event as a
   non-error.
   (merge c34fe63 sp/smart-http-failure-to-push later to maint).

 * "git bundle create" produced a corrupt bundle file upon seeing
   commits with excessively long subject line.
   (merge 8a557bb tr/maint-bundle-long-subject later to maint).

 * "gitweb" used to drop warnings in the log file when "heads" view is
   accessed in a repository whose HEAD does not point at a valid
   branch.
