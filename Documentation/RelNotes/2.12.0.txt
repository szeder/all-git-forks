Git 2.12 Release Notes
======================

Backward compatibility notes.

 * Use of an empty string that is used for 'everything matches' is
   still warned and Git asks users to use a more explicit '.' for that
   instead.  The hope is that existing users will not mind this
   change, and eventually the warning can be turned into a hard error,
   upgrading the deprecation into removal of this (mis)feature.  That
   is not scheduled to happen in the upcoming release (yet).

 * The historical argument order "git merge <msg> HEAD <commit>..."
   has been deprecated for quite some time, and will be removed in the
   upcoming release.


Updates since v2.11
-------------------

UI, Workflows & Features

 *


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.

 *


Also contains various documentation updates and code clean-ups.

 *


Fixes since v2.10
-----------------

Unless otherwise noted, all the fixes since v2.9 in the maintenance
track are contained in this release (see the maintenance releases'
notes for details).

 * We often decide if a session is interactive by checking if the
   standard I/O streams are connected to a TTY, but isatty() that
   comes with Windows incorrectly returned true if it is used on NUL
   (i.e. an equivalent to /dev/null).  This has been fixed.
   (merge cbb3f3c9b1 js/mingw-isatty later to maint).

 * "git svn" did not work well with path components that are "0", and
   some configuration variable it uses were not documented.
   (merge ea9a93dcc2 ew/svn-fixes later to maint).

 * Other minor doc, test and build updates and code cleanups.
