Git v2.10.2 Release Notes
=========================

Fixes since v2.10.1
-------------------

 * The code that parses the format parameter of for-each-ref command
   has seen a micro-optimization.

 * The "graph" API used in "git log --graph" miscounted the number of
   output columns consumed so far when drawing a padding line, which
   has been fixed; this did not affect any existing code as nobody
   tried to write anything after the padding on such a line, though.

 * Almost everybody uses DEFAULT_ABBREV to refer to the default
   setting for the abbreviation, but "git blame" peeked into
   underlying variable bypassing the macro for no good reason.

 * Doc update to clarify what "log -3 --reverse" does.

 * An author name, that spelled a backslash-quoted double quote in the
   human readable part "My \"double quoted\" name", was not unquoted
   correctly while applying a patch from a piece of e-mail.

 * The original command line syntax for "git merge", which was "git
   merge <msg> HEAD <parent>...", has been deprecated for quite some
   time, and "git gui" was the last in-tree user of the syntax.  This
   is finally fixed, so that we can move forward with the deprecation.

 * Codepaths that read from an on-disk loose object were too loose in
   validating what they are reading is a proper object file and
   sometimes read past the data they read from the disk, which has
   been corrected.  H/t to Gustavo Grieco for reporting.

 * "git worktree", even though it used the default_abbrev setting that
   ought to be affected by core.abbrev configuration variable, ignored
   the variable setting.  The command has been taught to read the
   default set of configuration variables to correct this.

 * A low-level function verify_packfile() was meant to show errors
   that were detected without dying itself, but under some conditions
   it didn't and died instead, which has been fixed.


Also contains minor documentation updates and code clean-ups.
