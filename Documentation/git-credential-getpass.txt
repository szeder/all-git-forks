git-credential-getpass(1)
=========================

NAME
----
git-credential-getpass - helper to request credentials from a user

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
git credential-getpass

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This command requests credentials from the user using git's "default"
scheme, including asking via the terminal and respecting the
`GIT_ASKPASS` environment variable; see linkgit:gitcredentials[7] for a
complete description. The helpers are provided on stdout using git's
credential helper protocol.

There is no point in using this program as a credential helper by
itself; it is exactly equivalent to git's behavior when no helper is
configured.

However, writers of third-party helpers may want to invoke this program
to simulate git's behavior.

EXAMPLES
--------

Here's a simple, silly example of a helper that stores credentials on
disk (similar to linkgit:git-credential-store[1]), and how it could use
the `getpass` helper.

-------------------------------------------
#!/bin/sh

STORAGE=$HOME/.credentials

for i in "$@"; do
	case "$i" in
	--unique=*)
		unique=${i#--unique=} ;;
	esac
done

if ! test -e "$STORAGE/$unique"; then
	mkdir -m 0700 "$STORAGE"
	git credential-getpass "$@" >"$STORAGE/$unique"
fi

cat "$STORAGE/$unique"
