GIT v1.6.0.5 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.6.0.4
--------------------

* 'git checkout' used to crash when your HEAD was pointing at a deleted
  branch.

* 'git checkout' from an un-checked-out state did not allow switching out
  of the current branch.

* 'git pack-objects' did not make its best effort to honor --max-pack-size
  option when a single first object already busted the given limit and
  placed many objects in a single pack.

* 'make check' cannot be run without sparse; people may have meant to say
  'make test' instead, so suggest that.

* Many unsafe call to sprintf() style varargs functions are corrected.
