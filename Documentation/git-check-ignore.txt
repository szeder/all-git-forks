git-check-ignore(1)
===================

NAME
----
git-check-ignore - Debug gitignore / exclude files


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git check-ignore' [options] pathname...
'git check-ignore' [options] --stdin < <list-of-paths>

DESCRIPTION
-----------

For each pathname given via the command-line or from a file via
`--stdin`, this command will list the first exclude pattern found (if
any) which explicitly excludes or includes that pathname.  Note that
within any given exclude file, later patterns take precedence over
earlier ones, so any matching pattern which this command outputs may
not be the one you would immediately expect.

OPTIONS
-------
-q, --quiet::
	Don't output anything, just set exit status.  This is only
	valid with a single pathname.

-v, --verbose::
	Also output details about the matching pattern (if any)
	for each given pathname.

--stdin::
	Read file names from stdin instead of from the command-line.

-z::
	The output format is modified to be machine-parseable (see
	below).  If `--stdin` is also given, input paths are separated
	with a NUL character instead of a linefeed character.

OUTPUT
------

By default, any of the given pathnames which match an ignore pattern
will be output, one per line.  If no pattern matches a given path,
nothing will be output for that path; this means that path will not be
ignored.

If `--verbose` is specified, the output is a series of lines of the form:

<source> <COLON> <linenum> <COLON> <pattern> <HT> <pathname>

<pathname> is the path of a file being queried, <pattern> is the
matching pattern, <source> is the pattern's source file, and <linenum>
is the line number of the pattern within that source.  If the pattern
contained a `!` prefix or `/` suffix, it will be preserved in the
output.  <source> will be an absolute path when referring to the file
configured by `core.excludesfile`, or relative to the repository root
when referring to `.git/info/exclude` or a per-directory exclude file.

If `-z` is specified, the output is a series of lines of the form:

EXIT STATUS
-----------

0::
	One or more of the provided paths is ignored.

1::
	None of the provided paths are ignored.

128::
	A fatal error was encountered.
