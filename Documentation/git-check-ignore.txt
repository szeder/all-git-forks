git-check-ignore(1)
===================

NAME
----
git-check-ignore - Debug gitignore / exclude files


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git check-ignore' pathname...
'git check-ignore' --stdin [-z] < <list-of-paths>

DESCRIPTION
-----------

For each pathname given via the command-line or from a file via
`--stdin`, this command will list the first exclude pattern found (if
any) which explicitly excludes or includes that pathname.  Note that
within any given exclude file, later patterns take precedence over
earlier ones, so any matching pattern which this command outputs may
not be the one you would immediately expect.

OPTIONS
-------
--stdin::
	Read file names from stdin instead of from the command-line.

-z::
	Only meaningful with `--stdin`; paths are separated with a
	NUL character instead of a linefeed character.

OUTPUT
------

The output is a series of lines of the form:

<path> COLON SP <type> SP <pattern> SP <source> SP <position> LF

<path> is the path of a file being queried, <type> is either
'excluded' or 'included' (for patterns prefixed with '!'), <pattern>
is the matching pattern, <source> is the pattern's source file (either
as an absolute path or relative to the repository root), and
<position> is the position of the pattern within that source.

If no pattern matches a given path, nothing will be output for that
path.
