git-index-helper(1)
===================

NAME
----
git-index-helper - A simple cache daemon for speeding up index file access

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git index-helper' [options]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Keep the index file in memory for faster access. This daemon is per
repository.

OPTIONS
-------

--exit-after=<n>::
	Exit if the cached index is not accessed for `<n>`
	minutes. Specify 0 to wait forever. Default is 10.

--strict::
--no-strict::
	Strict mode makes index-helper verify the shared memory after
	it's created. If the result does not match what's read from
	$GIT_DIR/index, the shared memory is destroyed. This makes
	index-helper take more than double the amount of time required
	for reading an index, but because it will happen in the
	background, it's not noticable. `--strict` is enabled by default.

--detach::
	Detach from the shell.

NOTES
-----
$GIT_DIR/index-helper.pipe is a named pipe that the daemon reads
commands from. At least on Linux, shared memory objects are availble
via /dev/shm with the name pattern "git-<something>-<SHA1>".  Normally
the daemon will clean up shared memory objects when it exits.  But if
it crashes, some objects could remain there and they can be safely
deleted with "rm" command. The following commands are used to control
the daemon:

"refresh"::
	Reread the index.

"poke":
	Let the daemon know the index is to be read. It keeps the
	daemon alive longer, unless `--exit-after=0` is used.

"poke <path>":
	Like "poke", but replies with "OK" by opening the named pipe
	at <path> and writing the string.  If watchman is configured,
	index-helper queries watchman, then prepares a shared memory
	object with the watchman index extension before replying.

All commands and replies are terminated by a 0 byte.
