git-index-helper(1)
===================

NAME
----
git-index-helper - A simple cache daemon for speeding up index file access

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git index-helper' [options]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Keep the index file in memory for faster access. This daemon is per
repository and per working tree.  So if you have two working trees
each with a submodule, you might need four index-helpers.  (In practice,
this is only worthwhile for large indexes, so only use it if you notice
that git status is slow).

OPTIONS
-------

--exit-after=<n>::
	Exit if the cached index is not accessed for `<n>`
	seconds. Specify 0 to wait forever. Default is 600.

NOTES
-----

$GIT_DIR/index-helper.sock a Unix domain socket that the daemon reads
commands from.  The directory will also contain files named
"shm-index-<SHA1>".  These are used as backing stores for shared
memory.  Normally the daemon will clean up these files when it exits
or when they are no longer relevant.  But if it crashes, some objects
could remain there and they can be safely deleted with "rm"
command. The following commands are used to control the daemon:

"refresh"::
	Reread the index.

"poke":
	Let the daemon know the index is to be read. It keeps the
	daemon alive longer, unless `--exit-after=0` is used.

All commands and replies are terminated by a NUL byte.
