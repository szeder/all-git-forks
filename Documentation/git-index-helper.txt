git-index-helper(1)
===================

NAME
----
git-index-helper - A simple cache daemon for speeding up index file access

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git index-helper' [options]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Keep the index file in memory for faster access. This daemon is per
repository.

OPTIONS
-------

--exit-after=<n>::
	Exit if the cached index is not accessed for `<n>`
	minutes. Specify 0 to wait forever. Default is 10.

--strict::
--no-strict::
	Strict mode makes index-helper verify the shared memory after
	it's created. If the result does not match what's read from
	$GIT_DIR/index, the shared memory is destroyed. This makes
	index-helper take more than double the amount of time required
	for reading an index, but because it will happen in the
	background, it's not noticable. `--strict` is enabled by default.

NOTES
-----
On UNIX-like systems, $GIT_DIR/index-helper.pid contains the process
id of the daemon. At least on Linux, shared memory objects are
availble via /dev/shm with the name pattern "git-<something>-<SHA1>".
Normally the daemon will clean up shared memory objects when it exits.
But if it crashes, some objects could remain there and they can be
safely deleted with "rm" command. The following signals are used to
control the daemon:

SIGHUP::
	Reread the index.

SIGUSR1::
	Let the daemon know the index is to be read. It keeps the
	daemon alive longer, unless `--exit-after=0` is used.
