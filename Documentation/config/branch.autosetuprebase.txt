branch.autosetuprebase::
	When a new branch is created with 'git branch' or 'git checkout'
	that tracks another branch, this variable tells Git to set
	up pull to rebase instead of merge (see "branch.<name>.rebase").
	When `never`, rebase is never automatically set to true.
	When `local`, rebase is set to true for tracked branches of
	other local branches.
	When `remote`, rebase is set to true for tracked branches of
	remote-tracking branches.
	When `always`, rebase will be set to true for all tracking
	branches.
	See "branch.autosetupmerge" for details on how to set up a
	branch to track another branch.
	This option defaults to never.
