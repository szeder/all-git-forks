pack.deltaCacheSize::
	The maximum memory in bytes used for caching deltas in
	linkgit:git-pack-objects[1] before writing them out to a pack.
	This cache is used to speed up the writing object phase by not
	having to recompute the final delta result once the best match
	for all objects is found.  Repacking large repositories on machines
	which are tight with memory might be badly impacted by this though,
	especially if this cache pushes the system into swapping.
	A value of 0 means no limit. The smallest size of 1 byte may be
	used to virtually disable this cache. Defaults to 256 MiB.
