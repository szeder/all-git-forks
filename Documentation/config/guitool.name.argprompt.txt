guitool.<name>.argprompt::
	Request a string argument from the user, and pass it to the tool
	through the 'ARGS' environment variable. Since requesting an
	argument implies confirmation, the 'confirm' option has no effect
	if this is enabled. If the option is set to 'true', 'yes', or '1',
	the dialog uses a built-in generic prompt; otherwise the exact
	value of the variable is used.
