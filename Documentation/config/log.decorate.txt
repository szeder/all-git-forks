log.decorate::
	Print out the ref names of any commits that are shown by the log
	command. If 'short' is specified, the ref name prefixes 'refs/heads/',
	'refs/tags/' and 'refs/remotes/' will not be printed. If 'full' is
	specified, the full ref name (including prefix) will be printed.
	This is the same as the log commands '--decorate' option.
