core.preloadindex::
	Enable parallel index preload for operations like 'git diff'
+
This can speed up operations like 'git diff' and 'git status' especially
on filesystems like NFS that have weak caching semantics and thus
relatively high IO latencies.  With this set to 'true', Git will do the
index comparison to the filesystem data in parallel, allowing
overlapping IO's.
