core.ignoreStat::
	If true, commands which modify both the working tree and the index
	will mark the updated paths with the "assume unchanged" bit in the
	index. These marked files are then assumed to stay unchanged in the
	working tree, until you mark them otherwise manually - Git will not
	detect the file changes	by lstat() calls. This is useful on systems
	where those are very slow, such as Microsoft Windows.
	See linkgit:git-update-index[1].
	False by default.
