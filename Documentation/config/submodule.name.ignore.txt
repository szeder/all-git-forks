submodule.<name>.ignore::
	Defines under what circumstances "git status" and the diff family show
	a submodule as modified. When set to "all", it will never be considered
	modified, "dirty" will ignore all changes to the submodules work tree and
	takes only differences between the HEAD of the submodule and the commit
	recorded in the superproject into account. "untracked" will additionally
	let submodules with modified tracked files in their work tree show up.
	Using "none" (the default when this option is not set) also shows
	submodules that have untracked files in their work tree as changed.
	This setting overrides any setting made in .gitmodules for this submodule,
	both settings can be overridden on the command line by using the
	"--ignore-submodules" option.
