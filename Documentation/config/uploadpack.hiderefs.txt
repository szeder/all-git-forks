	String(s) `upload-pack` uses to decide which refs to omit
	from its initial advertisement.  Use more than one
	definitions to specify multiple prefix strings. A ref that
	are under the hierarchies listed on the value of this
	variable is excluded, and is hidden from `git ls-remote`,
	`git fetch`, etc.  An attempt to fetch a hidden ref by `git
	fetch` will fail.
