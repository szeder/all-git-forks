core.askpass::
	Some commands (e.g. svn and http interfaces) that interactively
	ask for a password can be told to use an external program given
	via the value of this variable. Can be overridden by the 'GIT_ASKPASS'
	environment variable. If not set, fall back to the value of the
	'SSH_ASKPASS' environment variable or, failing that, a simple password
	prompt. The external program shall be given a suitable prompt as
	command line argument and write the password on its STDOUT.
