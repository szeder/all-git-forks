receive.denyCurrentBranch::
	If set to true or "refuse", git-receive-pack will deny a ref update
	to the currently checked out branch of a non-bare repository.
	Such a push is potentially dangerous because it brings the HEAD
	out of sync with the index and working tree. If set to "warn",
	print a warning of such a push to stderr, but allow the push to
	proceed. If set to false or "ignore", allow such pushes with no
	message. Defaults to "refuse".
