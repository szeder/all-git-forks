gpg.program::
	Use this custom program instead of "gpg" found on $PATH when
	making or verifying a PGP signature. The program must support the
	same command line interface as GPG, namely, to verify a detached
	signature, "gpg --verify $file - <$signature" is run, and the
	program is expected to signal a good signature by exiting with
	code 0, and to generate an ascii-armored detached signature, the
	standard input of "gpg -bsau $key" is fed with the contents to be
	signed, and the program is expected to send the result to its
	standard output.
