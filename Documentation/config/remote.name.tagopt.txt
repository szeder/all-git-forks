remote.<name>.tagopt::
	Setting this value to \--no-tags disables automatic tag following when
	fetching from remote <name>. Setting it to \--tags will fetch every
	tag from remote <name>, even if they are not reachable from remote
	branch heads. Passing these flags directly to linkgit:git-fetch[1] can
	override this setting. See options \--tags and \--no-tags of
	linkgit:git-fetch[1].
