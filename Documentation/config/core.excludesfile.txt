core.excludesfile::
	In addition to '.gitignore' (per-directory) and
	'.git/info/exclude', Git looks into this file for patterns
	of files which are not meant to be tracked.  "`~/`" is expanded
	to the value of `$HOME` and "`~user/`" to the specified user's
	home directory. Its default value is $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/ignore.
	If $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is either not set or empty, $HOME/.config/git/ignore
	is used instead. See linkgit:gitignore[5].
