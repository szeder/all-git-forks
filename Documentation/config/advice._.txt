advice.*::
	These variables control various optional help messages designed to
	aid new users. All 'advice.*' variables default to 'true', and you
	can tell Git that you do not need help by setting these to 'false':
+
--
	pushUpdateRejected::
		Set this variable to 'false' if you want to disable
		'pushNonFFCurrent', 'pushNonFFDefault',
		'pushNonFFMatching', 'pushAlreadyExists',
		'pushFetchFirst', and 'pushNeedsForce'
		simultaneously.
	pushNonFFCurrent::
		Advice shown when linkgit:git-push[1] fails due to a
		non-fast-forward update to the current branch.
	pushNonFFDefault::
		Advice to set 'push.default' to 'upstream' or 'current'
		when you ran linkgit:git-push[1] and pushed 'matching
		refs' by default (i.e. you did not provide an explicit
		refspec, and no 'push.default' configuration was set)
		and it resulted in a non-fast-forward error.
	pushNonFFMatching::
		Advice shown when you ran linkgit:git-push[1] and pushed
		'matching refs' explicitly (i.e. you used ':', or
		specified a refspec that isn't your current branch) and
		it resulted in a non-fast-forward error.
	pushAlreadyExists::
		Shown when linkgit:git-push[1] rejects an update that
		does not qualify for fast-forwarding (e.g., a tag.)
	pushFetchFirst::
		Shown when linkgit:git-push[1] rejects an update that
		tries to overwrite a remote ref that points at an
		object we do not have.
	pushNeedsForce::
		Shown when linkgit:git-push[1] rejects an update that
		tries to overwrite a remote ref that points at an
		object that is not a committish, or make the remote
		ref point at an object that is not a committish.
	statusHints::
		Show directions on how to proceed from the current
		state in the output of linkgit:git-status[1], in
		the template shown when writing commit messages in
		linkgit:git-commit[1], and in the help message shown
		by linkgit:git-checkout[1] when switching branch.
	commitBeforeMerge::
		Advice shown when linkgit:git-merge[1] refuses to
		merge to avoid overwriting local changes.
	resolveConflict::
		Advice shown by various commands when conflicts
		prevent the operation from being performed.
	implicitIdentity::
		Advice on how to set your identity configuration when
		your information is guessed from the system username and
		domain name.
	detachedHead::
		Advice shown when you used linkgit:git-checkout[1] to
		move to the detach HEAD state, to instruct how to create
		a local branch after the fact.
	amWorkDir::
		Advice that shows the location of the patch file when
		linkgit:git-am[1] fails to apply it.
