http.postBuffer::
	Maximum size in bytes of the buffer used by smart HTTP
	transports when POSTing data to the remote system.
	For requests larger than this buffer size, HTTP/1.1 and
	Transfer-Encoding: chunked is used to avoid creating a
	massive pack file locally.  Default is 1 MiB, which is
	sufficient for most requests.
