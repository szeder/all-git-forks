status.showUntrackedFiles::
	By default, linkgit:git-status[1] and linkgit:git-commit[1] show
	files which are not currently tracked by Git. Directories which
	contain only untracked files, are shown with the directory name
	only. Showing untracked files means that Git needs to lstat() all
	all the files in the whole repository, which might be slow on some
	systems. So, this variable controls how the commands displays
	the untracked files. Possible values are:
+
--
* `no` - Show no untracked files.
* `normal` - Show untracked files and directories.
* `all` - Show also individual files in untracked directories.
--
+
If this variable is not specified, it defaults to 'normal'.
This variable can be overridden with the -u|--untracked-files option
of linkgit:git-status[1] and linkgit:git-commit[1].
