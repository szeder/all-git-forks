core.logAllRefUpdates::

	"$GIT_DIR/logs/<ref>", by appending the new and old
	SHA1, the date/time and the reason of the update, but
	only when the file exists.  If this configuration
	variable is set to true, missing "$GIT_DIR/logs/<ref>"
	file is automatically created for branch heads (i.e. under
	refs/heads/), remote refs (i.e. under refs/remotes/),
	note refs (i.e. under refs/notes/), and the symbolic ref HEAD.
