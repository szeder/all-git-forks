notes.rewriteRef::
	When copying notes during a rewrite, specifies the (fully
	qualified) ref whose notes should be copied.  The ref may be a
	glob, in which case notes in all matching refs will be copied.
	You may also specify this configuration several times.
+
Does not have a default value; you must configure this variable to
enable note rewriting.  Set it to `refs/notes/commits` to enable
rewriting for the default commit notes.
+
This setting can be overridden with the `GIT_NOTES_REWRITE_REF`
environment variable, which must be a colon separated list of refs or
globs.
