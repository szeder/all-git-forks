gitcvs.dbname::
	Database used by git-cvsserver to cache revision information
	derived from the Git repository. The exact meaning depends on the
	used database driver, for SQLite (which is the default driver) this
	is a filename. Supports variable substitution (see
	linkgit:git-cvsserver[1] for details). May not contain semicolons (`;`).
	Default: '%Ggitcvs.%m.sqlite'
