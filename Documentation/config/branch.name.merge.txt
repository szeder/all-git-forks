branch.<name>.merge::
	Defines, together with branch.<name>.remote, the upstream branch
	for the given branch. It tells 'git fetch'/'git pull'/'git rebase' which
	branch to merge and can also affect 'git push' (see push.default).
	When in branch <name>, it tells 'git fetch' the default
	refspec to be marked for merging in FETCH_HEAD. The value is
	handled like the remote part of a refspec, and must match a
	ref which is fetched from the remote given by
	"branch.<name>.remote".
	The merge information is used by 'git pull' (which at first calls
	'git fetch') to lookup the default branch for merging. Without
	this option, 'git pull' defaults to merge the first refspec fetched.
	Specify multiple values to get an octopus merge.
	If you wish to setup 'git pull' so that it merges into <name> from
	another branch in the local repository, you can point
	branch.<name>.merge to the desired branch, and use the special setting
	`.` (a period) for branch.<name>.remote.
