http.useragent::
	The HTTP USER_AGENT string presented to an HTTP server.  The default
	value represents the version of the client Git such as git/1.7.1.
	This option allows you to override this value to a more common value
	such as Mozilla/4.0.  This may be necessary, for instance, if
	connecting through a firewall that restricts HTTP connections to a set
	of common USER_AGENT strings (but not including those like git/1.7.1).
	Can be overridden by the 'GIT_HTTP_USER_AGENT' environment variable.
