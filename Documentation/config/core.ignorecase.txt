core.ignorecase::
	If true, this option enables various workarounds to enable
	Git to work better on filesystems that are not case sensitive,
	like FAT. For example, if a directory listing finds
	"makefile" when Git expects "Makefile", Git will assume
	it is really the same file, and continue to remember it as
	"Makefile".

The default is false, except linkgit:git-clone[1] or linkgit:git-init[1]
will probe and set core.ignorecase true if appropriate when the repository
is created.
