core.ignoreCygwinFSTricks::
	This option is only used by Cygwin implementation of Git. If false,
	the Cygwin stat() and lstat() functions are used. This may be useful
	if your repository consists of a few separate directories joined in
	one hierarchy using Cygwin mount. If true, Git uses native Win32 API
	whenever it is possible and falls back to Cygwin functions only to
	handle symbol links. The native mode is more than twice faster than
	normal Cygwin l/stat() functions. True by default, unless core.filemode
	is true, in which case ignoreCygwinFSTricks is ignored as Cygwin's
	POSIX emulation is required to support core.filemode.
