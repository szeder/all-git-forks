core.notesRef::
	When showing commit messages, also show notes which are stored in
	the given ref.  The ref must be fully qualified.  If the given
	ref does not exist, it is not an error but means that no
	notes should be printed.

This setting defaults to "refs/notes/commits", and it can be overridden by
the 'GIT_NOTES_REF' environment variable.  See linkgit:git-notes[1].
