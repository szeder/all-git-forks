color.status.<slot>::
	Use customized color for status colorization. `<slot>` is
	one of `header` (the header text of the status message),
	`added` or `updated` (files which are added but not committed),
	`changed` (files which are changed but not added in the index),
	`untracked` (files which are not tracked by Git),
	`branch` (the current branch), or
	`nobranch` (the color the 'no branch' warning is shown in, defaulting
	to red). The values of these variables may be specified as in
	color.branch.<slot>.
