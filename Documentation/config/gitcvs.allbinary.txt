gitcvs.allbinary::
	This is used if 'gitcvs.usecrlfattr' does not resolve
	the correct '-kb' mode to use. If true, all
	unresolved files are sent to the client in
	mode '-kb'. This causes the client to treat them
	as binary files, which suppresses any newline munging it
	otherwise might do. Alternatively, if it is set to "guess",
	then the contents of the file are examined to decide if
	it is binary, similar to 'core.autocrlf'.
