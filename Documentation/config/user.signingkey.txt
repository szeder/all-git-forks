user.signingkey::
	If linkgit:git-tag[1] is not selecting the key you want it to
	automatically when creating a signed tag, you can override the
	default selection with this variable.  This option is passed
	unchanged to gpg's --local-user parameter, so you may specify a key
	using any method that gpg supports.
