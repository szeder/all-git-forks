fetch.recurseSubmodules::
	This option can be either set to a boolean value or to 'on-demand'.
	Setting it to a boolean changes the behavior of fetch and pull to
	unconditionally recurse into submodules when set to true or to not
	recurse at all when set to false. When set to 'on-demand' (the default
	value), fetch and pull will only recurse into a populated submodule
	when its superproject retrieves a commit that updates the submodule's
	reference.
