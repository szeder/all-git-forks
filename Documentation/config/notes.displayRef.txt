notes.displayRef::
	The (fully qualified) refname from which to show notes when
	showing commit messages.  The value of this variable can be set
	to a glob, in which case notes from all matching refs will be
	shown.  You may also specify this configuration variable
	several times.  A warning will be issued for refs that do not
	exist, but a glob that does not match any refs is silently
	ignored.
+
This setting can be overridden with the `GIT_NOTES_DISPLAY_REF`
environment variable, which must be a colon separated list of refs or
globs.
+
The effective value of "core.notesRef" (possibly overridden by
GIT_NOTES_REF) is also implicitly added to the list of refs to be
displayed.
