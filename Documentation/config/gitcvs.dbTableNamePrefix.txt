gitcvs.dbTableNamePrefix::
	Database table name prefix.  Prepended to the names of any
	database tables used, allowing a single database to be used
	for several repositories.  Supports variable substitution (see
	linkgit:git-cvsserver[1] for details).  Any non-alphabetic
	characters will be replaced with underscores.

All gitcvs variables except for 'gitcvs.usecrlfattr' and
'gitcvs.allbinary' can also be specified as
'gitcvs.<access_method>.<varname>' (where 'access_method'
is one of "ext" and "pserver") to make them apply only for the given
access method.
