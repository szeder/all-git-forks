core.pager::
	The command that Git will use to paginate output.  Can
	be overridden with the `GIT_PAGER` environment
	variable.  Note that Git sets the `LESS` environment
	variable to `FRSX` if it is unset when it runs the
	pager.  One can change these settings by setting the
	`LESS` variable to some other value.  Alternately,
	these settings can be overridden on a project or
	global basis by setting the `core.pager` option.
	Setting `core.pager` has no effect on the `LESS`
	environment variable behaviour above, so if you want
	to override Git's default settings this way, you need
	to be explicit.  For example, to disable the S option
	in a backward compatible manner, set `core.pager`
	to `less -+S`.  This will be passed to the shell by
	Git, which will translate the final command to
	`LESS=FRSX less -+S`.
