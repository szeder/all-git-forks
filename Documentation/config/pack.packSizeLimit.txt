pack.packSizeLimit::
	The maximum size of a pack.  This setting only affects
	packing to a file when repacking, i.e. the git:// protocol
	is unaffected.  It can be overridden by the `--max-pack-size`
	option of linkgit:git-repack[1]. The minimum size allowed is
	limited to 1 MiB. The default is unlimited.
	Common unit suffixes of 'k', 'm', or 'g' are
	supported.
