pack.threads::
	Specifies the number of threads to spawn when searching for best
	delta matches.  This requires that linkgit:git-pack-objects[1]
	be compiled with pthreads otherwise this option is ignored with a
	warning. This is meant to reduce packing time on multiprocessor
	machines. The required amount of memory for the delta search window
	is however multiplied by the number of threads.
	Specifying 0 will cause Git to auto-detect the number of CPU's
	and set the number of threads accordingly.
