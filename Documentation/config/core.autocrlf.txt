core.autocrlf::
	Setting this variable to "true" is almost the same as setting
	the `text` attribute to "auto" on all files except that text
	files are not guaranteed to be normalized: files that contain
	`CRLF` in the repository will not be touched.  Use this
	setting if you want to have `CRLF` line endings in your
	working directory even though the repository does not have
	normalized line endings.  This variable can be set to 'input',
	in which case no output conversion is performed.
