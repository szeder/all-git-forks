pack.indexVersion::
	Specify the default pack index version.  Valid values are 1 for
	legacy pack index used by Git versions prior to 1.5.2, and 2 for
	the new pack index with capabilities for packs larger than 4 GB
	as well as proper protection against the repacking of corrupted
	packs.  Version 2 is the default.  Note that version 2 is enforced
	and this config option ignored whenever the corresponding pack is
	larger than 2 GB.

If you have an old Git that does not understand the version 2 `*.idx` file,
cloning or fetching over a non native protocol (e.g. "http" and "rsync")
that will copy both `*.pack` file and corresponding `*.idx` file from the
other side may give you a repository that cannot be accessed with your
older version of Git. If the `*.pack` file is smaller than 2 GB, however,
you can use linkgit:git-index-pack[1] on the *.pack file to regenerate
the `*.idx` file.
