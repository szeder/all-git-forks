pack.compression::
	An integer -1..9, indicating the compression level for objects
	in a pack file. -1 is the zlib default. 0 means no
	compression, and 1..9 are various speed/size tradeoffs, 9 being
	slowest.  If not set,  defaults to core.compression.  If that is
	not set,  defaults to -1, the zlib default, which is "a default
	compromise between speed and compression (currently equivalent
	to level 6)."
+
Note that changing the compression level will not automatically recompress
all existing objects. You can force recompression by passing the -F option
to linkgit:git-repack[1].
