receive.hiderefs::
	String(s) `receive-pack` uses to decide which refs to omit
	from its initial advertisement.  Use more than one
	definitions to specify multiple prefix strings. A ref that
	are under the hierarchies listed on the value of this
	variable is excluded, and is hidden when responding to `git
	push`, and an attempt to update or delete a hidden ref by
	`git push` is rejected.
