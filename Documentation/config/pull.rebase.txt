pull.rebase::
	When true, rebase branches on top of the fetched branch, instead
	of merging the default branch from the default remote when "git
	pull" is run. See "branch.<name>.rebase" for setting this on a
	per-branch basis.
+
*NOTE*: this is a possibly dangerous operation; do *not* use
it unless you understand the implications (see linkgit:git-rebase[1]
for details).
