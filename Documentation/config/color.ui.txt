color.ui::
	This variable determines the default value for variables such
	as `color.diff` and `color.grep` that control the use of color
	per command family. Its scope will expand as more commands learn
	configuration to set a default for the `--color` option.  Set it
	to `always` if you want all output not intended for machine
	consumption to use color, to `true` or `auto` if you want such
	output to use color when written to the terminal, or to `false` or
	`never` if you prefer Git commands not to use color unless enabled
	explicitly with some other configuration or the `--color` option.
