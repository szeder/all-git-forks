core.quotepath::
	The commands that output paths (e.g. 'ls-files',
	'diff'), when not given the `-z` option, will quote
	"unusual" characters in the pathname by enclosing the
	pathname in a double-quote pair and with backslashes the
	same way strings in C source code are quoted.  If this
	variable is set to false, the bytes higher than 0x80 are
	not quoted but output as verbatim.  Note that double
	quote, backslash and control characters are always
	quoted without `-z` regardless of the setting of this
	variable.
