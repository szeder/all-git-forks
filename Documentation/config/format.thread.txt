format.thread::
	The default threading style for 'git format-patch'.  Can be
	a boolean value, or `shallow` or `deep`.  `shallow` threading
	makes every mail a reply to the head of the series,
	where the head is chosen from the cover letter, the
	`--in-reply-to`, and the first patch mail, in this order.
	`deep` threading makes every mail a reply to the previous one.
	A true boolean value is the same as `shallow`, and a false
	value disables threading.
