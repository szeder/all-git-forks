gc.packrefs::
	Running `git pack-refs` in a repository renders it
	unclonable by Git versions prior to 1.5.1.2 over dumb
	transports such as HTTP.  This variable determines whether
	'git gc' runs `git pack-refs`. This can be set to `notbare`
	to enable it within all non-bare repos or it can be set to a
	boolean value.  The default is `true`.
