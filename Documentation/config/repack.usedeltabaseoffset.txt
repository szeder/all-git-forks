repack.usedeltabaseoffset::
	By default, linkgit:git-repack[1] creates packs that use
	delta-base offset. If you need to share your repository with
	Git older than version 1.4.4, either directly or via a dumb
	protocol such as http, then you need to set this option to
	"false" and repack. Access from old Git versions over the
	native protocol are unaffected by this option.
