git-test(1)
===========

NAME
----
git-test - evaluates one or more conditions about the state of the git working tree, index or repository

SYNOPSIS
--------
The git test API is available in the form of a command and also as a shell library. 

COMMAND SYNOPSIS
----------------
[verse]
'git test' [-q] [--message message] [--<condition> [ arg ... ]] ...

LIBRARY SYNOPSIS
----------------
[verse]
'assert' [-q] [--message message] [--<condition> [ arg ... ]] ...
'test_condition' [--<condition> [ arg ... ]] ...
'require_condition_libs'


DESCRIPTION
-----------
`git test` provides a uniform, extensible API for evaluating various conditions that
pertain to the state of a git working tree, index and repository.

Specified conditions are evaluated from left to right. If any condition evaluates to false, 
the command conditionally prints a diagnostic message to stderr and sets a 
non-zero status code. Otherwise, sets a status code of zero. 

The message used to report a assertion failure may be overidden by specifying the --message option.

Diagnostic output resulting from an assertion failure may be suppressed with the -q option. 
Note that the -q option does not suppress diagnostic output that results from the failure to 
successfully parse the arguments that configure the test API.

The `assert` and `test_condition` functions differ according to how they handle failing conditions. 

The `assert` function behaves like the test command but assertion failures will cause 
the current shell to exit with a non-zero status code. To prevent this occurring, invoke
the `assert` function within a subshell or use the `test_condition` function instead.

The `test_condition` function will not exit the current shell in the event that an assertion failure
is detected nor will it generate diagnostic relating to an assertion failure to stderr. 

Note, however, that `test_condition` may still exit the current shell with a non-zero status code 
if it is unable to successfully parse the arguments presented to it. Callers who need to protect 
against this possibility either guarantee that the required arguments are available or 
imbed calls to `test_condition` within a subshell.

The `require_condition_libs` function may be used to include any condition libs listed
in condition.lib variables of the the git configuration.


OPTIONS
-------
'--message'::
	The message to be used to report a failure if an assertion fails.
'-q'::	
        Suppress assertion messages.

CONDITIONS
----------
'--unstaged'|'--not-unstaged'::
	Tests if there are (not) any unstaged changes in the working tree.
'--staged'|'--not-staged'::
        Tests if there are (not) any staged changes in the index.
'--untracked'|'--not-untracked'::
	Tests if there are (not) any untracked files in the working tree.
'--conflicted'|'--not-conflicted'::
	Tests if there are (not) any merge conflicts in the index.

EXTENDING THE CONDITION LIBRARY
-------------------------------
The library of conditions that the assert API can process may be extended by 
adding functions of the form check_\{dehyphenated_condition_name\}_N to the 
shell environment, where \{dehyphenated_condition_name\} is the result of 
replacing any occurrence of \'-\' in the condition name with \'_\' and 
N is the number of arguments that need to be passed to the function.

For example, suppose you are writing a script, foo.sh, that includes the git test library 
and that you want to add a new, 1-argument, condition, foo-X to the library of 
conditions that can be tested by the git testion framework. 

---------
#/bin/sh
. $(git --exec-path)/git-test-lib

check_foo_X_1()
{
    if # some test of $1
    then
	echo "foo-X is true"
    else
	echo "foo-X is false"
	false
    fi
}

assert --foo-X "somearg"
--------
If its condition holds, the condition function must set a status
code of zero and write a non-empty message describing the condition to stdout.
If its condition does not hold, the condition function must set a non-zero
status code of zero and write a non-empty message describing the condition
that does hold to stdout.

It is an error, and is reported as such, if a condition function
executes without generating any output on stdout. The resulting
state will then be interpreted as condition evaluation failure
rather than an assertion failure.

To make such conditions available to the git test command line, put the 
function in a file called ~/foo-lib,sh add a reference 
to the library to the git configuration, like so:

---------
git config --add condition.lib ~/foo-lib.sh
git test --foo-X one-arg                     # now use foo-X from the git test command line
---------

CONFIGURATION
-------------
condition.lib::
	Specifies a shell library that contains definitions of one or more
	condition check functions that can be used to extend the range
	of conditions that can be used with the git test API.

EXAMPLES
--------
* Reset the working tree to the specified commit, but only the current HEAD is tree-same with that commit
! git assert -q --tree-same HEAD upstream/master || git reset --hard upstream/master
* Reset the working tree, but only if there are no staged or unstaged changes
+
-----------
git test --not-staged --not-unstaged && git reset --hard another-commit
-----------
* Import the git-test-lib library into another script
+
-----------
. $(git --exec-path)/git-test-lib
assert --not-staged   	      	                              # die if there are any staged files
assert --message "there are staged files" --not-staged	      # die with an alternative message 
                                                              # if there are any staged files
test_condition --not-staged || echo "there are staged files"  # check whether there are staged files, 
                                                              # but do not die if there are
