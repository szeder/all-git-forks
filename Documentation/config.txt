CONFIGURATION FILE
------------------

The Git configuration file contains a number of variables that affect
the Git commands' behavior. The `.git/config` file in each repository
is used to store the configuration for that repository, and
`$HOME/.gitconfig` is used to store a per-user configuration as
fallback values for the `.git/config` file. The file `/etc/gitconfig`
can be used to store a system-wide default configuration.

The configuration variables are used by both the Git plumbing
and the porcelains. The variables are divided into sections, wherein
the fully qualified variable name of the variable itself is the last
dot-separated segment and the section name is everything before the last
dot. The variable names are case-insensitive, allow only alphanumeric
characters and `-`, and must start with an alphabetic character.  Some
variables may appear multiple times.

Syntax
~~~~~~

The syntax is fairly flexible and permissive; whitespaces are mostly
ignored.  The '#' and ';' characters begin comments to the end of line,
blank lines are ignored.

The file consists of sections and variables.  A section begins with
the name of the section in square brackets and continues until the next
section begins.  Section names are not case sensitive.  Only alphanumeric
characters, `-` and `.` are allowed in section names.  Each variable
must belong to some section, which means that there must be a section
header before the first setting of a variable.

Sections can be further divided into subsections.  To begin a subsection
put its name in double quotes, separated by space from the section name,
in the section header, like in the example below:

--------
	[section "subsection"]

--------

Subsection names are case sensitive and can contain any characters except
newline (doublequote `"` and backslash have to be escaped as `\"` and `\\`,
respectively).  Section headers cannot span multiple
lines.  Variables may belong directly to a section or to a given subsection.
You can have `[section]` if you have `[section "subsection"]`, but you
don't need to.

There is also a deprecated `[section.subsection]` syntax. With this
syntax, the subsection name is converted to lower-case and is also
compared case sensitively. These subsection names follow the same
restrictions as section names.

All the other lines (and the remainder of the line after the section
header) are recognized as setting variables, in the form
'name = value'.  If there is no equal sign on the line, the entire line
is taken as 'name' and the variable is recognized as boolean "true".
The variable names are case-insensitive, allow only alphanumeric characters
and `-`, and must start with an alphabetic character.  There can be more
than one value for a given variable; we say then that the variable is
multivalued.

Leading and trailing whitespace in a variable value is discarded.
Internal whitespace within a variable value is retained verbatim.

The values following the equals sign in variable assign are all either
a string, an integer, or a boolean.  Boolean values may be given as yes/no,
1/0, true/false or on/off.  Case is not significant in boolean values, when
converting value to the canonical form using '--bool' type specifier;
'git config' will ensure that the output is "true" or "false".

String values may be entirely or partially enclosed in double quotes.
You need to enclose variable values in double quotes if you want to
preserve leading or trailing whitespace, or if the variable value contains
comment characters (i.e. it contains '#' or ';').
Double quote `"` and backslash `\` characters in variable values must
be escaped: use `\"` for `"` and `\\` for `\`.

The following escape sequences (beside `\"` and `\\`) are recognized:
`\n` for newline character (NL), `\t` for horizontal tabulation (HT, TAB)
and `\b` for backspace (BS).  No other char escape sequence, nor octal
char sequences are valid.

Variable values ending in a `\` are continued on the next line in the
customary UNIX fashion.

Some variables may require a special value format.

Includes
~~~~~~~~

You can include one config file from another by setting the special
`include.path` variable to the name of the file to be included. The
included file is expanded immediately, as if its contents had been
found at the location of the include directive. If the value of the
`include.path` variable is a relative path, the path is considered to be
relative to the configuration file in which the include directive was
found. The value of `include.path` is subject to tilde expansion: `~/`
is expanded to the value of `$HOME`, and `~user/` to the specified
user's home directory. See below for examples.

Example
~~~~~~~

	# Core variables
	[core]
		; Don't trust file modes
		filemode = false

	# Our diff algorithm
	[diff]
		external = /usr/local/bin/diff-wrapper
		renames = true

	[branch "devel"]
		remote = origin
		merge = refs/heads/devel

	# Proxy settings
	[core]
		gitProxy="ssh" for "kernel.org"
		gitProxy=default-proxy ; for the rest

	[include]
		path = /path/to/foo.inc ; include by absolute path
		path = foo ; expand "foo" relative to the current file
		path = ~/foo ; expand "foo" in your $HOME directory

Note that this list is non-comprehensive and not necessarily complete.
For command-specific variables, you will find a more detailed description
in the appropriate manual page. You will find a description of non-core
porcelain configuration variables in the respective porcelain documentation.
