git-upload-pack(1)
==================

NAME
----
git-upload-pack - Send objects packed back to git-fetch-pack


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git-upload-pack' [--strict] [--timeout=<n>] <directory> [<capabilities>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Invoked by 'git fetch-pack', learns what
objects the other side is missing, and sends them after packing.

This command is usually not invoked directly by the end user.
The UI for the protocol is on the 'git fetch-pack' side, and the
program pair is meant to be used to pull updates from a remote
repository.  For push operations, see 'git send-pack'.


OPTIONS
-------

--strict::
	Do not try <directory>/.git/ if <directory> is no Git directory.

--timeout=<n>::
	Interrupt transfer after <n> seconds of inactivity.

<directory>::
	The repository to sync from.

capabilities::
	Historically the capabilities were exchanged inside the protocol of
	'git-upload-pack' talking to 'git-fetch-pack'. It turned out this was
	too late as 'git-upload-pack' already did work, which may have been
	avoided. This allows to pass in the capabilities the client wants to
	use as one argument. The capabilites are separated by space.
	See technical/protocol-capabilities.txt (TODO: how to make it a link?)
