This directory contains facilities that allow to highlight changes
between two images and to perform a 3-way merge of images.

Prerequisites
-------------

ImageMagick - http://www.imagemagick.org/script/download.php


Installation
------------

Copy the files imgdiff and imgmerge into a directory that is in your PATH.


Usage
-----

Activate imgdiff in your repository

a.	Define a custom diff driver:

		$ git config diff.imgdiff.command imgdiff

b.	Use the custom driver for your images, i.e. put
	a line like this in your .git/info/attributes:

			*.png	diff=imgdiff

Since this uses ImageMagick behind the scenes, all image formats
are supported that your ImageMagick installation supports.

You can also run the program from the command line like this:

	$ imgdiff pictureold.png picturenew.png

Activate imgmerge in your repository


a.	Define a custom merge driver:

		$ git config merge.imgmerge.name "image merge driver"
		$ git config merge.imgmerge.driver "imgmerge %O %A %B %A"

b.	Use the custom driver for your images, i.e. put
	a line like this in your .git/info/attributes:

			*.png	merge=imgmerge

You can also run the merge driver from the command line like this:

	$ imgmerge base.png ours.png theirs.png result.png

The merge algorithm produces no conflict if the changes on the branches
("base" to "ours" vs. "base" to "theirs") are on disjoint sets of
pixels. If the branches modify the same pixel, then this results in a
conflict, and the conflicting pixels are set to "ours".

The merge does not work with images that have an alpha channel.
