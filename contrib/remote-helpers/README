The remote-helper bridges to access data stored in Hg and bzr will be
maintained outside the git.git tree in the repositories of its
primary author at:

    https://github.com/felipec/git-remote-hg
    https://github.com/felipec/git-remote-bzr

As a convenience, copies of the last-bundled version of these two
remote-helper bridges are kept here, but they may left stale.  Users
are encouraged to visit the above authoritative repositories for the
latest versions to get involved in its further developments.
