Subject: [PATCH v2 0/4] urlmatch: allow regexp-based matches
To: git@vger.kernel.org

Hi,

This is version two of my patch series.

The use case is to be able to configure an HTTP proxy for all
subdomains of a domain where there are hundreds of subdomains.

Previously, I have been using complete regular expressions with
an escape-mechanism to match the configuration key's URLs.
According to Junio's comments, I changed this mechanism to a much
simpler one, where the user is only allowed to use globbing for
the host part of the URL. That is a user can now specify a key
`http.https://*.example.com` to match all sub-domains of
`example.com`. For now I've decided to implement it such that a
single `*` matches a single subdomain only, so for example
`https://foo.bar.example.com` would not match in this case. This
is similar to how shell-globbing works usually, so it should not
be of much surprise. It's also highlighted in the documentation.

I did not include an interdiff as too much has changed between
the two versions.

Regards
Patrick
