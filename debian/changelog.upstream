==========================

--------------------                                                            
                                                                                
* Bugfixes                                                              
                                                              
  - git-add tried to optimize by finding common leading         
    directories across its arguments but botched, causing very  
    confused behaviour.                                                         
                                                                                
  - unofficial rpm.spec file shipped with git was letting             
    ETC_GITCONFIG set to /usr/etc/gitconfig.  Tweak the official  
    Makefile to make it harder for distro people to make the        
    same mistake, by setting the variable to /etc/gitconfig if                  
    prefix is set to /usr.                                          
                                                                                
  - git-svn inconsistently stripped away username from the URL                  
    only when svnsync_props was in use.                                 
                                                                                
  - git-svn got confused when handling symlinks on Mac OS.                     
                                                                                
  - git-send-email was not quoting recipient names that have                    
    period '.' in them.  Also it did not allow overriding                       
    envelope sender, which made it impossible to send patches to                
    certain subscriber-only lists.                                              
                                          
  - built-in write_tree() routine had a sequence that renamed a
    file that is still open, which some systems did not like.
                                              
  - when memory is very tight, sliding mmap code to read                       
    packfiles incorrectly closed the fd that was still being
    used to read the pack.

  - import-tars contributed front-end for fastimport was passing
    wrong directory modes without checking.

  - git-fastimport trusted its input too much and allowed to
    create corrupt tree objects with entries without a name.

  - git-fetch needlessly barfed when too long reflog action
    description was given by the caller.

Also contains various documentation updates.

GIT v1.5.1.2 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.5.1.1
--------------------

* Bugfixes

  - "git clone" over http from a repository that has lost the
    loose refs by running "git pack-refs" were broken (a code to
    deal with this was added to "git fetch" in v1.5.0, but it
    was missing from "git clone").

  - "git diff a/ b/" incorrectly fell in "diff between two
    filesystem objects" codepath, when the user most likely
    wanted to limit the extent of output to two tracked
    directories.

  - git-quiltimport had the same bug as we fixed for
    git-applymbox in v1.5.1.1 -- it gave an alarming "did not
    have any patch" message (but did not actually fail and was
    harmless).

  - various git-svn fixes.

  - Sample update hook incorrectly always refused requests to
    delete branches through push.

  - git-blame on a very long working tree path had buffer
    overrun problem.

  - git-apply did not like to be fed two patches in a row that created
    and then modified the same file.

  - git-svn was confused when a non-project was stored directly under
    trunk/, branches/ and tags/.

  - git-svn wants the Error.pm module that was at least as new
    as what we ship as part of git; install ours in our private
    installation location if the one on the system is older.

  - An earlier update to command line integer parameter parser was
    botched and made 'update-index --cacheinfo' completely useless.


* Documentation updates

  - Various documentation updates from J. Bruce Fields, Frank
    Lichtenheld, Alex Riesen and others.  Andrew Ruder started a
    war on undocumented options.

GIT v1.5.1.1 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.5.1
------------------

* Documentation updates

  - The --left-right option of rev-list and friends is documented.

  - The documentation for cvsimport has been majorly improved.

  - "git-show-ref --exclude-existing" was documented.

* Bugfixes

  - The implementation of -p option in "git cvsexportcommit" had
    the meaning of -C (context reduction) option wrong, and
    loosened the context requirements when it was told to be
    strict.

  - "git cvsserver" did not behave like the real cvsserver when
    client side removed a file from the working tree without
    doing anything else on the path.  In such a case, it should
    restore it from the checked out revision.

  - "git fsck" issued an alarming error message on detached
    HEAD.  It is not an error since at least 1.5.0.

  - "git send-email" produced of References header of unbounded length;
    fixed this with line-folding.

  - "git archive" to download from remote site should not
    require you to be in a git repository, but it incorrectly
    did.

  - "git apply" ignored -p<n> for "diff --git" formatted
    patches.

  - "git rerere" recorded a conflict that had one side empty
    (the other side adds) incorrectly; this made merging in the
    other direction fail to use previously recorded resolution.

  - t4200 test was broken where "wc -l" pads its output with
    spaces.

  - "git branch -m old new" to rename branch did not work
    without a configuration file in ".git/config".

  - The sample hook for notification e-mail was misnamed.

  - gitweb did not show type-changing patch correctly in the
    blobdiff view.

  - git-svn did not error out with incorrect command line options.

  - git-svn fell into an infinite loop when insanely long commit
    message was found.

  - git-svn dcommit and rebase was confused by patches that were
    merged from another branch that is managed by git-svn.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Arjen Laarhoven (4):
      usermanual.txt: some capitalization nits

GIT v1.5.0.3 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.5.0.2
--------------------

* Bugfixes

  - 'git.el' honors the commit coding system from the configuration.

  - 'blameview' in contrib/ correctly digs deeper when a line is
    clicked.

  - 'http-push' correctly makes sure the remote side has leading
    path.  Earlier it started in the middle of the path, and
    incorrectly.

  - 'git-merge' did not exit with non-zero status when the
    working tree was dirty and cannot fast forward.  It does
    now.

  - 'cvsexportcommit' does not lose yet-to-be-used message file.

  - int-vs-size_t typefix when running combined diff on files
    over 2GB long.

  - 'git apply --whitespace=strip' should not touch unmodified
    lines.

  - 'git-mailinfo' choke when a logical header line was too long.

  - 'git show A..B' did not error out.  Negative ref ("not A" in
    this example) does not make sense for the purpose of the
    command, so now it errors out.

  - 'git fmt-merge-msg --file' without file parameter did not
    correctly error out.

  - 'git archimport' barfed upon encountering a commit without
    summary.

  - 'git index-pack' did not protect itself from getting a short
    read out of pread(2).

  - 'git http-push' had a few buffer overruns.

  - Build dependency fixes to rebuild fetch.o when other headers
    change.

* Documentation updates

  - user-manual updates.

  - Options to 'git remote add' were described insufficiently.

  - Configuration format.suffix was not documented.

  - Other formatting and spelling fixes.

GIT v1.5.0.2 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.5.0.1
--------------------

* Bugfixes

  - Automated merge conflict handling when changes to symbolic
    links conflicted were completely broken.  The merge-resolve
    strategy created a regular file with conflict markers in it
    in place of the symbolic link.  The default strategy,
    merge-recursive was even more broken.  It removed the path
    that was pointed at by the symbolic link.  Both of these
    problems have been fixed.

  - 'git diff maint master next' did not correctly give combined
    diff across three trees.

  - 'git fast-import' portability fix for Solaris.

  - 'git show-ref --verify' without arguments did not error out
    but segfaulted.

  - 'git diff :tracked-file `pwd`/an-untracked-file' gave an extra
    slashes after a/ and b/.

  - 'git format-patch' produced too long filenames if the commit
    message had too long line at the beginning.

  - Running 'make all' and then without changing anything
    running 'make install' still rebuilt some files.  This
    was inconvenient when building as yourself and then
    installing as root (especially problematic when the source
    directory is on NFS and root is mapped to nobody).

  - 'git-rerere' failed to deal with two unconflicted paths that
    sorted next to each other.

  - 'git-rerere' attempted to open(2) a symlink and failed if
    there was a conflict.  Since a conflicting change to a
    symlink would not benefit from rerere anyway, the command
    now ignores conflicting changes to symlinks.

  - 'git-repack' did not like to pass more than 64 arguments
    internally to underlying 'rev-list' logic, which made it
    impossible to repack after accumulating many (small) packs
    in the repository.

  - 'git-diff' to review the combined diff during a conflicted
    merge were not reading the working tree version correctly
    when changes to a symbolic link conflicted.  It should have
    read the data using readlink(2) but read from the regular
    file the symbolic link pointed at.

  - 'git-remote' did not like period in a remote's name.

* Documentation updates

  - added and clarified core.bare, core.legacyheaders configurations.

  - updated "git-clone --depth" documentation.


* Assorted git-gui fixes.

Subject:    [ANNOUNCE] GIT 1.5.0.1
From:       Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net>
Date:       Sun, 18 Feb 2007 18:07:42 -0800

usual places:

GIT v1.5.0.1 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.5.0
------------------

* Documentation updates

  - Clarifications and corrections to 1.5.0 release notes.

  - The main documentation did not link to git-remote documentation.

  - Clarified introductory text of git-rebase documentation.

  - Converted remaining mentions of update-index on Porcelain
    documents to git-add/git-rm.

  - Some i18n.* configuration variables were incorrectly
    described as core.*; fixed.

* Bugfixes

  - git-add and git-update-index on a filesystem on which
    executable bits are unreliable incorrectly reused st_mode
    bits even when the path changed between symlink and regular
    file.

  - git-daemon marks the listening sockets with FD_CLOEXEC so
    that it won't be leaked into the children.

  - segfault from git-blame when the mandatory pathname
    parameter was missing was fixed; usage() message is given
    instead.

  - git-rev-list did not read $GIT_DIR/config file, which means
    that did not honor i18n.logoutputencoding correctly.

* Tweaks

  - sliding mmap() inefficiently mmaped the same region of a
    packfile with an access pattern that used objects in the
    reverse order.  This has been made more efficient.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Changes since v1.5.0 are as follows (gitk changes were already
in v1.5.0 -- listed below are the commits that came through
Paul's official gitk repository):

Alexandre Julliard (2):
      git-daemon: Avoid leaking the listening sockets into child processes.

The latest feature release GIT 1.4.4 is available at the usual
places:

  http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/

  git-1.4.4.tar.{gz,bz2}                        (tarball)

  RPMS/$arch/git-*-1.4.4-1.$arch.rpm    (RPM)

Quite a lot of changes during the last month.

 - pack-refs, along with a lot of internal clean-up of the code
   that deal with refs, is in.  A repository with many tags
   would benefit from packing and pruning them.  Currently dumb
   transports are not capable of fetching from a repository that
   has packed and pruned its refs, so please keep that in mind.
   Hopefully we will get an update for dumb transports shortly.

 - git native transport can now keep transferred packs without
   exploding it into loose objects.  Also "git repack" can be
   told to keep "historical" packs from getting repacked by
   marking them with .keep file.  Docmentation update is
   probably needed.

 - git-blame can now detect line movements across files.  No, it
   is not called git-pickaxe.

 - a lot of gitweb and git-svn updates.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Changes since v1.4.3 are as follows:

Alan Chandler:
      Gitweb - provide site headers and footers

Alex Riesen:
      merge-recursive implicitely depends on trust_executable_bit

Alexandre Julliard:

Subject:    [ANNOUNCE] GIT 1.4.3
From:       Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net>
Date:       2006-10-18 23:53:22

The latest feature release GIT 1.4.3 is available at the usual
places:

  http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/

  git-1.4.3.tar.{gz,bz2}			(tarball)
  git-htmldocs-1.4.3.tar.{gz,bz2}		(preformatted docs)
  git-manpages-1.4.3.tar.{gz,bz2}		(preformatted docs)
  RPMS/$arch/git-*-1.4.3-1.$arch.rpm	(RPM)

Please holler if i386 RPMs are broken, since they are not cut on
the machine I am used to use (I ended up burning half a day
installing and futzing with FC5 on my older laptop resurrected
from the boneyard).

User visible changes, other than bugfixes, since v1.4.2.4 are:

 - upload-tar is deprecated but not removed; we now have
   upload-archive --format=tar and --format=zip instead.

 - ftp:// protocol is supported the same way as http:// and
   https://

 - git-diff paginates its output to the tty by default.  If this
   irritates you, using LESS=RF might help.

 - git-cherry-pick does not leave often useless "cherry-picked
   from" message.

 - git-merge-recursive was replaced by a rewritten implemention
   in C.  The original Python implementation is available as
   "recursive-old" strategy for now, but hopefully we can remove
   it in the next cycle.

 - git-daemon can do name based virtual hosting.

 - git-daemon can serve tar and zip snapshots.

 - many gitweb tweaks and cleanups.

 - git-apply --reverse, --reject.

 - git-diff --color highlights whitespace errors.

 - git-diff --stat can be taught to use non-default widths.

 - git-status can use colors.

 - many more commands are built-in.

Subject:    [ANNOUNCE] GIT 1.4.2.4
From:       Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net>
Date:       2006-10-17 5:31:56

The latest maintenance release GIT 1.4.2.4 is available at the
usual places:

  http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/

  git-1.4.2.4.tar.{gz,bz2}			(tarball)
  git-htmldocs-1.4.2.4.tar.{gz,bz2}		(preformatted docs)
  git-manpages-1.4.2.4.tar.{gz,bz2}		(preformatted docs)
  RPMS/$arch/git-*-1.4.2.4-1.$arch.rpm	(RPM)

We are close to 1.4.3, so this update coulc become moot very
soon, but just in case we have to delay it, I am pushing this
out for a rather important performance fix.  Without it, "git
diff" on 64-bit machines can run 100x times slower than it
should be on unfortunate input.

Many thanks go to Jim Mayering for giving an easy to reproduce
initial problem report, and Linus and Davide Libenzi to quickly
come up with a fix.

Unfortunately I do not have access to any RPM capable machine
other than an x86-64 right now hence there is no RPM for x86-32
for this release yet (but 32-bit machines do not need this fix
to begin with, so it's Ok).

----------------------------------------------------------------

There is only one change since v1.4.2.3.

Linus Torvalds:

From:       Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net>
Date:       2006-10-02 8:17:19

The latest maintenance release GIT 1.4.2.3 is available at the
usual places:

  http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/

  git-1.4.2.3.tar.{gz,bz2}                      (tarball)
  git-htmldocs-1.4.2.3.tar.{gz,bz2}             (preformatted docs)
  git-manpages-1.4.2.3.tar.{gz,bz2}             (preformatted docs)
  RPMS/$arch/git-*-1.4.2.3-1.$arch.rpm  (RPM)

Sorry to be doing two maintenance releases in rapid succession,
but git-mv breakage causes random tree corruption and is rather
serious.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Changes since v1.4.2.2 are as follows:

Junio C Hamano:
      git-mv: invalidate the removed path properly in cache-tree
      git-push: .git/remotes/ file does not require SP after colon

The latest maintenance release GIT 1.4.2.2 is available at the

This is strictly a bugfix release.  While we will soon be in
stabilization slow-down for 1.4.3, one of the bugs this release
contains fixes for actually has bitten people who use the kernel
commits mailing list, so this is to push the fixes out early.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Changes since v1.4.2.1 are as follows:

Junio C Hamano:
      Fix git-am safety checks
      git-diff -B output fix.

Liu Yubao:
      Fix duplicate xmalloc in builtin-add

Subject:    [ANNOUNCE] GIT 1.4.2.1
From:       Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net>
Date:       2006-09-13 19:19:21

The latest maintenance release GIT 1.4.2.1 is available at the
usual places:

  http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/

  git-1.4.2.1.tar.{gz,bz2}                      (tarball)

  RPMS/$arch/git-*-1.4.2.1-1.$arch.rpm  (RPM)

This release is primarily for these two fixes:

 * git-mv was broken.  Notably, this did not work:

        git-mv foo foo-renamed

 * git-http-fetch failed to follow objects/info/alternates on
   the remote side.  This broke a fetch from Paul's powerpc.git
   repository.

I have built i386 and x86_64 RPM this time, since the machine I
do the former has become available again.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Changes since v1.4.2 are as follows:

Dennis Stosberg:
      Solaris does not support C99 format strings before version 10

Johannes Schindelin:
      git-mv: succeed even if source is a prefix of destination
      git-mv: add more path normalization
      git-mv: special case destination "."
      git-mv: fix off-by-one error
      builtin-mv: readability patch

Junio C Hamano:
      finish_connect(): thinkofix
      http-fetch: fix alternates handling.

Luben Tuikov:
      Fix regex pattern in commit-msg
      sample commit-msg hook: no silent exit on duplicate Signed-off-by lines

Subject:    [ANNOUNCE] GIT 1.4.1.1
From:       Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net>
Date:       2006-07-25 3:53:29

The latest maintenance release GIT 1.4.1.1 is available at the
usual places:

  http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/

  git-1.4.1.1.tar.{gz,bz2}			(tarball)
  git-htmldocs-1.4.1.1.tar.{gz,bz2}		(preformatted docs)
  git-manpages-1.4.1.1.tar.{gz,bz2}		(preformatted docs)
  RPMS/$arch/git-*-1.4.1.1-1.$arch.rpm	(RPM)

The primary purpose of this release is to fix the breakage
people reported while cloning large quantity of data via git
protocol, and the server side incorrectly timing out.  I am very
sorry for the breakage.

A big thanks goes to Matthias Lederhofer who fixed the breakage
for us.  The fix was cherry-picked from the "master" branch.

The "master" branch has the same fix already and we will have an
1.4.2-rc2 sometime this week, hopefully soon.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Changes since v1.4.1 are as follows:

Junio C Hamano:
      Makefile: tighten git-http-{fetch,push} dependencies

Linus Torvalds:
      revision.c: fix "dense" under --remove-empty

Matthias Lederhofer:
      upload-pack: fix timeout in create_pack_file

Robin Rosenberg:
      Empty author may be presented by svn as an empty string or a null value.
